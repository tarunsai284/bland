In a letter to shareholders appearing in the company ' s newly - issued 1986 annual report , Coastal chairman Oscar Wyatt did not elaborate on how much earnings were expected to increase . The 1986 profits of Coastal , a natural gas production and pipeline company , were halved from 1985 levels due to slumping energy prices . The company ' s sales totaled 6 . 7 billion dlrs last year . Coastal also said it sold its natural gas for an average price of 2 . 17 dlrs per mcf in 1986 , a drop of 18 pct from the previous year . Oil and natural gas liquids sold for an average 14 . 20 dlrs a barrel in 1986 , a reduction of 37 pct . The Houston - based company , which produced a daily average of 120 mln cubic feet of gas and 11 , 149 barrels of oil , said it had proved reserves at yearend 1986 of 28 . 6 mln barrels of oil and 954 billion cubic feet of natural gas . Average reserve replacement costs were 8 . 28 dlrs per barrel of oil equivalent during the past three - year period , representing a little more than half of the industry average , the company said .

1130,"TAFT & lt ; TFB > STOCK RISES ON PROPOSAL Taft Broadcasting Co stock rose almost three points today as its vice chairman and an investment group proposed to sweeten a takeover offer for the company . However , several arbitragers said they would shy away from the stock at its current price levels since it is unclear how high bidding for the company would go and whether the company would agree to a takeover . "" There are too many uncertainties ,"" said one arbitrager . Taft stock rose 2 - 7 / 8 to 155 - 3 / 4 . Dudley Taft , Taft vice chairman , and Narragansett Capital Inc said they sent a letter to the Taft board , stating they were committed to pursuing acquisition of the broadcast company and were prepared to negotiate a transaction in excess of 150 dlrs per share . The company responded that the proposal would be submitted to the board of directors , but that no decisions have yet been made on a sale of the company . "" Someone ' s betting this company will go for 170 ( dlrs per share ),"" said one arbitrager . Arbitragers said the stock is a risky buy at current levels , unless an offer was accepted in the 170 dlr per share range . They said to make an arbitrage investment at this level would be chancy since it will take a long time for any transaction to be completed because of regulatory approvals necessary for the broadcast properites . Taft earlier rejected a 145 dlr per share or 1 . 35 billion dlr bid from the investment group . The company said it rejected the bid as inadequate based on advice of Goldman , Sachs and Co , its financial adviser . It said it would consider alternatives such as restructuring . Arbitragers speculated a bidding war may erupt for Taft , which has two large shareholders in an investment group led by Robert Bass and Carl Lindner , chairman of American Financial Corp . The Bass group holds 25 pct of Taft and Lindner holds 16 . 2 pct . The Taft family , which founded the company almost 50 years ago , has about 12 pct . Lindner last week told the Securities and Exchange Commission he may be interested in making a bid for Taft . "" I could see if things got really crazy that it might go for 175 ( dlrs per share ),"" said one arbitrager , but he speculated it probably would not even be taken over for more than a price in the 160s . Another speculated that Lindner might bid , but he speculated the investor would not really be interested in running the company . Lindner was unavailable for comment . Dennis McAlpine , an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co , said he had speculated the company might be considering a leveraged buyout . "" Ideally , you ' d have to break this thing up to satisfy all the interests involved ,"" he said , adding the two largest shareholders might be interested in pieces of Taft . He said the highest takeover price he calculated for the company has been about 140 dlrs per share , but that the highest estimates on Wall Street have been about 160 . He said the latter would be based on more optimistic expectations for the broadcast industry ."

1147,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN BUYING OVERSEAS FIRMS More U . S . And European firms will be falling prey to Japanese corporations bulging with cash and eager to extend their reach further overseas , according to merger and acquisitions specialists polled by Reuters . Already , rich Japanese companies have pounced on U . S . Banks , steel and other businesses . In the latest attempt , Fujitsu Ltd & lt ; ITSU . T > -- Japan ' s biggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for & lt ; Fairchild Semiconductor Corp >, a U . S . Microchip maker which supplies components for supercomputers . Nomura Securities Co Ltd & lt ; NMSC . T > and Daiwa Securities Co Ltd & lt ; DSEC . T >, Japan ' s two largest brokerage firms , are seeking a niche in the U . S . And European securities markets , while the country ' s huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseas banking , the takeover specialists said . Major trading houses , which see their profits evaporating in the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade , all have foreign businesses on their shopping lists . Among manufacturers , car parts makers are under the most pressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big auto makers they subcontract for as these move offshore . "" The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy up potential overseas businesses , especially in the U . S . -- Japan ' s largest market and where political risks are minimal ,"" a takeover specialist at one trading company said . Japanese companies have become among the world ' s richest after a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbed against the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months . But the yen ' s strength , which has also raised the costs of Japan ' s exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move into its traditional markets , has frozen Japanese corporate growth , the specialists said . Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect more barriers against Japanese exports . Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoid the gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work . Domestic interest rates , now at record lows , offer little investment opportunity . "" Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous , but the recent economic factors have become a driving force ,"" said a banking industry source . So far , though , the Japanese are being cautious . While mergers and acquisitions among U . S . Firms number in the thousands , Japanese buyouts of overseas companies have totalled just a few dozen , one merchant banker said . Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japanese acquisition activity was originally expected five years from now , but that time span appeared now to be too long . Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now , he said . A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and Chemicals Inc ' s & lt ; DIAC . T > takeover bid for & lt ; Sun Chemical Corp > of the U . S . Last year , which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile , he added . Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical ' s graphic arts group for 550 mln dlrs late last year , after an earlier unsolicited bid for the whole company . Sun Chemical refused to sell its entire business after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate all but its graphic arts - related businesses . Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon by the Japanese , the trading company official says . "" Japanese people don ' t like fighting . They prefer peaceful amicable deals ."" But now after some experience overseas , Japanese companies are acquainted with local practice , he adds . "" This is a healthy progression ."" However , the experts do not expect the Japanese to run the board meetings of any giant U . S . Or European concerns . "" Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing a large U . S . Or European corporation ,"" one banker said . "" They will expand their operations only gradually , a typical way for Japanese business ."" A foreign merchant banker also noted , "" There are not many mega - deals left to do in the United States . A lot of the big deals there have already been done ."" But medium - size and small concerns are potential targets of Japanese companies , the specialists said . Japanese will be aiming for new businesses in high - technology areas . "" Japanese companies had used technology and quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviate from that trend ,"" one takeover specialist said . Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions . If these succeed , activity could build , the specialists said . But few such specialists are going to sit back and wait until the action begins . Already , they said , Japanese trading houses , long - term credit and commercial banks , brokerages and foreign merchant banks have set up research sections to act as go - betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves ."

GenCorp stock closed yesterday in composite tape trading at 90 . 50 dlrs a share , up two dlrs on the day . In a newspaper advertisement , General Partners said the offer and withdrawal rights expire April 14 unless extended . General Partners said the offer is conditioned on receipt of sufficient financing to buy all shares on a fully diluted basis and receipt of enough shares to give General Partners at least 51 pct voting power , again fully diluted . It said the offer is also conditioned on GenCorp redeeming the defensive rights or General Partners being satisfied that the rights have been invalidated and General Partners obtaining from the Federal Communications Commission a special temporary authorization allowing completion of the acquisition of GenCorp shares . General Partners said it would set up voting trust arrangements pending review of its long - form application for FCC approval of its acquisition of control of GenCorp ' s broadcasting subsidiary . The partnership said the offer is further conditioned on GenCorp management withdrawing its proposals to amend the company ' s articles of incorporation and code of regulations to provide for an increase in authorized common shares , a classified board of directors and the elimination of cumulative voting . The latter two changes would make it harder for minority shareholders to elect directors . General Partners said it is asking GenCorp for its shareholder lists for help in disseminating the offer .

1185,"TALKING POINT / GENCORP INC & lt ; GY > The surprise 2 . 2 billion - dlr tender offer for Ohio - based conglomerate GenCorp Inc will not be enough to buy the company , analysts said . Analysts estimated the 100 dlr - per - share offer from General Partners is 10 to 20 dlrs per share below the breakup value of GenCorp . However , market sources and analysts said uncertainty surrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges to Gencorp broadcasting licenses . Gencorp ' s stock rose 15 - 3 / 4 to 106 - 1 / 4 in heavy trading . "" The expectation is either there will be someone else or the bidder will sweeten the offer hoping to get management ' s cooperation ,"" said Larry Baker , an analyst with E . F . Hutton group . Analysts said there is concern about challenges to Gencorp ' s broadcast licenses for two television and 12 radio stations . Some of the disputes , dating back about 20 years , were brought by groups that alleged improper foreign payments and political contributions . "" I think it kind of muddies an already muddy situation ,"" said Baker of the offer . Some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issue might be a stumbling block or result in a long period of time for any transaction . A source close to General Partners , however , said General Partners would apply to the Federal Communications Commission for special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations . The source said if approved , the authority would allow a transaction to be carried out . If it received the "" short - form "" approval , General Partners would set up a trust which would hold the broadcasting properties until the licensing situation is resolved . General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner and Brown and glass - maker AFG Industries Inc . Some market sources speculated an outside buyer , such as General Partners , might even be be a catalyst to resolution of the challenges since it would carry out GenCorp ' s plan to sell the stations . GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with Walt Disney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station , WHJ - TV . Disney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to a group that challenged the station ' s license . GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR - TV in Secaucus , N . J . to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs . General Partners said it intends to keep the company ' s plastics and industrial products businesses and its tires and related products segment . Charles Rose , an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co , said that , on a breakup valuation , the company might be worth as much as 125 dlrs per share . Rose estimated the aerospace business could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billion dlrs , as would DiversiTech , the plastics unit . Broadcasting , including assets pending sale , might be 30 to 40 dlrs per share , he said . The company , formerly known as General Tire and Rubber Co , also has a tire business Rose estimated would be worth five to 10 dlrs per share . He estimated the bottling business might also be worth several dollars per share , he said . Analysts said GenCorp chairman A . William Reynolds , who became chairman last year , has been emphasizing the company ' s Aerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses . GenCorp , founded in 1915 , became an unfocused conglomerate over the years and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve . "" The management ' s doing a very fine job in trying to deal with the non - strategic assets of the company ,"" Rose said . Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer , but they declined to predict what steps the company might take . They said it would be possible the company might consider a leveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer . General Partners holds 9 . 8 pct of GenCorp stock , and there was some concern about "" greenmail ."" Greenmail is the payment at a premium for an unwanted shareholders ' stock . "" I would doubt they would greenmail them , but nothing surprises me anymore ,"" said Rose . GenCorp has not commented on the offer .

1207,"HAWKER SIDDELEY CANADA TO SELL UNIT & lt ; Hawker Siddeley Canada Inc > said that , due to poor market conditions for railway freight car manufacturing , it plans to sell its Trenton Works division in Trenton , Nova Scotia . Hawker Siddeley said it set aside a provision of 7 . 7 mln dlrs for the proposed sale .

Hawker Siddeley also said demand for new railway equipment was limited with export sales frequently restrained by customers ' financing difficulties . Demand for steel castings and wheels for Canadian railways continued to be very depressed with maintenance requirements at the lowest level in the past decade . However , there was demand for industrial casting due to increased hydro - electric power generation , the company said . The company said manufacturing of mining machinery and tunnelling equipment showed greatly improved results in the U . S . and export markets , mainly China and India . The Orenda division maintained a high level of activity in aircraft engine repair and overhaul and in the manufacture of engine components .

1214,"AIR CANADA COURIER BUY SHARPLY ALTERS INDUSTRY Air Canada ' s 54 mln U . S . dlr acquisition of Gelco Corp ' s & lt ; GEC > Canadian unit has dramatically altered Canada ' s fast growing courier industry , largely dominated by U . S . companies until this year , company officials and analysts said . State - owned Air Canada takes over the country ' s second largest overnight courier business just two months after another Canadian company , & lt ; Onex Capital Corp Ltd >, approved the acquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from New Jersey - based Purolator Courier Corp & lt ; PCC >. But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted by financial restructuring undertaken by the U . S . parent companies and likely don ' t represent an industry trend toward buying out foreign owned courier operations . "" It ' s a case of whether you can buy from the right people at the right time ,"" McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analyst Tony Hine commented . The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by U . S . companies embroiled in a take - over or restructuring to sell - off their Canadian units to generate ready cash , said Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin . "" There is a very good correlation between the U . S . parent selling Canadian subsidiaries and the U . S . parent either being under siege or taking someone else over ,"" he said . Gelco Corp , of Minnesota , decided to sell Gelco Express Ltd as part of its previously announced program to sell off four operating units to buy back shares and pay down debt , Gelco Express marketing vice president James O ' Neil told Reuters . The sale is the first under Gelco ' s divestiture program , and proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln U . S . dlrs of debt by year - end , the company said . While company officials declined to disclose earnings and revenue figures , O ' Neil said Gelco Express holds a dominant position in the industry , handling more than 50 , 000 packages a day and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrs a year . The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unit formed an important part of a company restructuring program , adopted after another Canadian Company , & lt ; Unicorp Canada Corp >, acquired a 12 . 6 pct stake in Purolator and said it would consider acquiring the whole company . Last month , Purolator agreed to be acquired by a company formed by E . F . Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of Purolator ' s U . S . courier business . For Air Canada , its acquisition of Gelco ' s Canadian courier business represents an "" excellent financial investment "" in a market it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually , spokesman Esther Szynkarsky said . The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake in EMS Corp , of Calgary , an in - city messenger service . It did not disclose financial terms , but Szynkarsky said the two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs , and the two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs . She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada ' s strategy of seeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline business . Gelco will continue to operate with current management , independently of Air Canada , although Air Canada already operates its own air cargo business that includes a small door - to - door courier operation . "" They ' re well run , they ' re a good investment , they ' re doing well in a growing market , and that ' s the way we want to keep it ,"" Szynkarsky said . Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian units will likely retain operating links with their U . S . delivery network , generating traffic for the former parent companies without them having to tie up capital in Canada . "" The nature of the business is that incremental traffic is incremental revenue ,"" Hine said . "" It ' s sort of a sausage maker business where you put in place the sausage grinder , and the more sausage you can stuff through , the more money you make ,"" he added ."

1227,"FLEET & lt ; FLT > AIMS TO SPEED MERGER WITH NORSTAR Fleet Financial Group hopes its proposed merger with Norstar Bancorp & lt ; NOR >, ranked as the largest U . S . banking merger , can be completed by the beginning of 1988 , according to an executive of Fleet . Robert Lougee , director of corporate communications for Rhode Island - based Fleet , told Reuters the company is exploring the possiblity of seeking a change in the national trigger date for the state ' s reciprocal bank law to Jan 1 , 1988 from July one . The decision is up to the Rhode Island legislature . The merger plan was announced in a midday news release that said the deal , worth about 1 . 3 billion dlrs , would be consummated July one when Rhode Island barriers to interstate banking outside of New England come down . "" If we can consummate the deal earlier that would be better for all concerned ,"" Lougee said . He said to the best of his knowledge a change in the Rhode Island law would not be a hardship for any other banking institution in the state . He said Fleet is optimstic Connecticut law , which only permits interstate banking mergers within New England , can be amended . Fleet owns First Connecticut Bancorp . If the Connecticut law is not amended in time , Lougee said , an option would be to spin off that unit with repurchase provisions . The New England reciprocal banking laws have excluded New York as a means of protecting regional banks from being gobbled up by the money center giants . Wall Street analysts said the merger accord between Fleet and Albany , N . Y .- based Norstar demonstrates the rapid pace of interstate banking mergers since state legislatures begain permitting regional mergers on a reciprocal basis . The U . S . Supreme Court decided in mid - 1985 to permit the mergers . Fleet and Norstar in a joint statement billed the proposed merger as "" a partnership of two companies ."" Both will continue to operate existing headquarters after the merger . Norstar holders will receive 1 . 2 Fleet shares for each one of theirs following Fleet ' s previously announced two - for - one split . Fleet shares closed today at 59 - 1 / 2 , up 1 / 8 , giving the deal an indicated value of 1 . 3 billion dlrs . That topped the proposed merger of Los Angeles - based Security Pacific Corp & lt ; SPC > and Seattle ' s Rainier Bancorpartion & lt ; RBAN >. The West Coast deal , announced about four weeks ago , is worth an estimated 1 . 2 billion dlrs . Chemical New York Corp ' s & lt ; CHL > acquisition of Texas Commerce Bancshares last year was valued at about 1 . 2 billion dlrs , making it similar in size to the Security Pacific - Rainer deal . The California combination of Wells Fargo and Co & lt ; WFC > and Crocker National Corp last year was worth 1 . 1 billion dlrs and there have been several bank mergers in the southeast valued in the 700 - 800 mln dlr range . "" It ' s a merger of equals ,"" said analyst John Rooney of Moseley Securities Corp . He said Norstar had a book value at the end of 1986 of 19 . 63 dlrs per share , while Fleet ' s book value was 28 . 02 dlrs . Rooney noted that Norstar chairman Peter Kiernan is in his 60 ' s while Fleet ' s Terrence Murray is in his late 40 ' s . He said Kiernan would probably head the combined company until his retirement then Murray could assume the top post . Analyst Thaddeus Paluszek of Merrill Lynch and Co said Fleet ' s earnings would have been diluted about two pct in 1986 on the basis of the merger terms announced today . He noted that Fleet has a "" teriffic reputation "" after having diversified in a number of financial areas . Fleet has established consumer banks in the southeast and is known as an innovator in securitization of mortgages . The merged banks would have assets in excess of 25 billion dlrs and be one of the 25 largest banks in the U . S . Norstar operates in most of New York state but not in New York City . Lougee said at some point in the future banking operations that both Norstar and Fleet operate in the state of Maine would be combined . The agreement between Norstar and Fleet includes a "" lock - up "" option designed to deter other acquirers . Each granted the other an option to purchase authorized but unissued shares amounting to 24 . 99 pct of the fully diluted shares outstanding ."

1254,"TALKING POINT / VIACOM INTERNATIONAL & lt ; VIA > A bidding war for Viacom International Inc , one of the largest U . S . entertainment companies , pitted a management group and other investors against National Amusements Inc , a closely held theater operator . Both sides raised their bids over the weekend . A source close to the management side insisted that timing was on his side . He said if outside directors approve the management proposal , a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders with proxy material going out late this week . "" It would take 20 days from the day we mail ,"" said the source . The source predicted National Amusements , controlled by investor Sumner Redstone , would need "" half a year "" to complete a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must accompany any change in control of Viacom ' s broadcast licenses and cable television franchises . Redstone was not available for comment . Some of Wall Street ' s arbitrage players said it was a rare situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war . One said Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to the Viacom management plan , he would have a chance to win . The independent directors of Viacom were called into a meeting today . Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow . Viacom shares climbed 2 - 1 / 2 to 50 - 3 / 8 by midafternoon . One major Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation . "" We think we ' re at the end now , in terms of bidding ,"" said the firm ' s arbitrageur , who spoke on condition he not be identified . Both Redstone ' s proposal and the management proposal would create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt . The management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2 . 5 billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred stock , convertible into 45 pct of the common stock . Redstone ' s newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash , a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a value of 7 . 50 dlrs , and one - fifth of a share of common stock stock of Arsenal Holdings , representing 20 pct of the equity interest in the restructured Viacom . One arbitrageur calculated the equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2 . 50 dlrs making the total package worth 52 dlrs per share . Management offered 38 . 50 dlrs in cash , exchangeable preferred stock worth 8 . 50 dlrs and a fractional share of convertible preferred . The arbitrageur said the equity portion was worth about 4 . 00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs . Redstone ' s newest plan raised the amount of interest he would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond April 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated . The plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct during May and 12 pct thereafter . Previously Redstone offered eight pct interest . Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management group , led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes , were offering high prices . "" Redstone really wants to own the company ,"" one said . Another said management seemed to have the edge on the timing issue . Redstone ' s company owns 19 . 6 pct ov Viacom ' s 35 mln shares . A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth . He noted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp & lt ; FMC >, which adopted a highly leveraged structure last year , inititally traded at 12 . 50 dlrs per share , dipped to nine dlrs , and is now just over 30 dlrs . Last week , Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two two cts per share from 23 cts . The company said interest costs from several acquisitions affected results . Shares of Warner Communications Inc & lt ; WCI > rose 7 / 8 to 31 - 1 / 8 . Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3 . 25 mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1 . 25 mln shares at 37 . 50 dlrs . Chris Craft Industries & lt ; CCN >, which owns a stake in Warner , rose 1 - 1 / 4 to 22 - 3 / 4 . Viacom was created in 1970 and spun off from CBS Inc & lt ; CBS >.

Henderson said , "" Our pharmaceutical business gets lost in the way that Glaxo ' s ( Glaxo Holdings PLC ) does not ."" ICI ' s pharmaceutical division is the second largest drug maker behind Glaxo in the U . K . Last year U . S . drug sales were about 40 pct of its worldwide drug sales of 1 . 5 billion dlrs , which in turn brought in 27 pct of its total profits .

1286,"TALKING POINT / AMERICAN EXPRESS & lt ; AXP > American Express Co ' s plan to sell a stake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers is believed to be a prelude to a public offering of shares in the brokerage unit , analysts said . American Express earlier said it has a general understanding with Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan to sell a 13 pct interest in Shearson for 530 mln dlrs . The statement triggered a rise in other brokerage stocks , as investors speculated on the possibility of more investment in the U . S . brokerage industry by Japanese concerns . The stocks of brokerage firms also climbed in response to the relatively high value Nippon put on its stake in the U . S . firm . Analysts said the 530 mln dlrs for 13 pct represents a price of 2 . 7 times book value . Perrin Long of Lipper analytical said the brokerage stocks , depressed somewhat by the dark cloud of the U . S . insider trading scandal , closed out February at a market value of 1 . 8 times book value . American Express was trading today at 78 - 1 / 4 , off 3 / 8 . For the last several weeks , the stock has been strong on rumors of a spinoff of part of Shearson . Analysts said American Express and its Shearson unit will benefit from the doors Nippon Life can open to the increasingly important Tokyo financial markets . "" I think this , in all honesty , is a preliminary step ,"" said Long . "" What you will see probably in the future is American Express selling an additional 17 pct in the public market and have a public vehicle for Shearson ,"" Long said . "" Normally , investors do not make a major capital commitment into an illiquid situation ,"" he said of Nippon . Some analysts previously speculated a 20 pct stake in Shearson might be sold to the public . They said the firm , like other investment banks , needs capital to expand globally . American express has said the total employees of shearson will expand by 20 pct in 1987 internationally . However , that number is substantially lower than growth last year , a company spokesman said . American Express officials would not comment beyond a statement made this morning . That statement , however , did not close off the possibility of a public offering or other option for Shearson . David Anthony , a Smith Barney analyst , said it is possible Shearson would be partially sold to the public . But he believes the firm will digest the Nippon investment first . "" I think they ' ll figure out what they ' re going to do with the money they have ,"" he said . Joan Goodman , an analyst with Pershing and Co , also said American Express could determine to sell shares to the public . In its statement , the financial services giant said it is continuing to study various plans for Shearson in addition to the investment by Nippon . American Express said options under study range from expanding Shearson ' s capacity to meet international competition to broadening its access to capital . American Express also said the options reflect the continuing integral role of Shearson in American Express ' worldwide financial services strategy . Shearson follows Goldman , Sachs and Co in finding a Japanese partner . Goldman last year sold a 12 . 5 pct stake to Sumitomo Bank in exchange for a 500 mln dlr capital infusion . Analysts speculated there will be more such matches . "" Those ( U . S . brokers ) companies have the expertise . They don ' t have the money . There ' s just not enough internal capital growth ,"" said Wertheim analyst James Hanbury , who follows other U . S . brokerage companies . Hanbury said some Japanese companies , flush with cash , are interested in the expertise of American brokers . "" Those ( Japanese ) companies have the capital and our companies have the capital needs and the growth opportunities to use the money . That ' s a nice marriage ,"" he said .

1296,"PESCH SEES SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT IN AMI & lt ; AMI > BID Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch said he has had discussions with several American Medical International Inc shareholders and sees support for a restructuring of the company . Pesch said he has discussed his sweetened , 1 . 91 billion dlr takeover bid for American Medical with several large shareholders , including the biggest investor , the Bass family of Texas . However , the Bass family has not indicated support one way or the other for his offer , he said . Pesch , in an interview with Reuters , said based on the conversations he held with shareholders , he could not guage whether he had majority support . He said , however , there is support for his offer . Pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he held discussions other than the Bass family and the Wedge Group Inc , the only other holder of more than five pct of American Medical stock . Earlier today , Wedge Group , which has a 5 . 5 pct stake , said it held discussions with Pesch , American Medical management and other American Medical shareholders . Wedge , in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , said it believes a restructuring of American Medical and its business would be "" highly desirable and appropriate at this time ."" "" That ' s the sort of position that I find a large segment of shareholders of AMI really share ,"" said Pesch . Pesch said he held discussions with Wedge about joining his takeover effort , in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash , four dlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for each American Medical share . Wedge said it has no plans to join in an effort to seek control of American Medical , but it would not rule out a future takeover try . Pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposal with the Bass family . Some analysts saw the Wedge statement as a boost to Pesch ' s takeover effort and a further sign that there could be some shareholder dissatisfaction following American Medical ' s previous rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer from Pesch . American Medical is expected to resist Pesch ' s latest bid . Larry Feinberg , an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said a management - led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out . An American Medical spokesman said the company will comment on the new Pesch offer by March 10 . Analysts continue to view the Bass family as a factor in the outcome of the bid for control of American Medical . The Bass family holds an 11 . 6 pct stake in American Medical , and the company has previously said the investors support management ' s internal plan to improve the company ' s performance . The Bass family would not comment on American Medical or Pesch . Pesch , who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp last year , continues to face a credibilty problem on Wall Street because of the long time it took to finish the Republic acquisition . Republic also has substantial debt , and has left wall street questioning whether financing can be completed for the much larger American Medical takeover proposal . Pesch ' s first offer for American Medical was made without an investment banking firm , another cause for concern to Wall Street . However , Pesch entered his second offer with representation from Donaldson , Lufkin , and Jenrette Securities and Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group . "" I don ' t have any doubt that the current transaction can be worked out and completed , provided we get to the point where Ami management will sit down and talk in a friendly environment ,"" Pesch said . Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing arrangements are being made . He did say if he succeeds in acquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of American Medical management in place . He said he plans to combine the company with Republic to form an efficient network of hospitals . Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could be made for American Medical . Byron Nimocks of E . F . Hutton Group said improved second fiscal quarter earnings could make American Medical stock worth about 20 dlrs per share . Nimocks estimates American Medical earnings for the second quarter ended February 28 could be 35 cts , compared to a 95 ct loss last year . Nimocks said Pesch ' s revised offer is not worth much more than the 20 dlrs cash offered previously . But Feinberg said there is a better chance a transaction could be completed because of the revised structure of the offer . "" I think it ' s much more doable ,"" he said . Analysts have said American Medical has begun a turnaround by replacing some members of management and reducing costs ."

1312,"SWISS BANKER WANTS BOND RATINGS , SHARE DISCLOSURE A top Swiss banker called for an obligatory , continuous rating for all Swiss franc bonds and said he believed anyone buying more than five pct of a company should be made to declare their share . In comments at a news conference of & lt ; Vontobel Holding AG >, chairman Hans Vontobel said he believed it was up to the banks ' own self - regulating bodies , such as the Swiss Admissions Board , to take such action before governmental bodies stepped in . A decline in the average quality of borrowers on the Swiss franc market and a debate on the use of registered shares to prevent takeovers have made both major issues among bankers . Vontobel noted that many borrowers already came to the market with ratings from the major U . S . Agencies , which were readily available to professionals through specialised information systems . "" We should make this classification obligatory and publish it in places that are easily accessible to lay people ,"" he said . The quick changing nature of the financial market meant these ratings should also be continually updated , he said . Vontobel also noted that recent years had seen companies , worried about takeovers , increasingly issuing registered shares and participation certificates rather than bearer shares . However , both types of issue had a drawback , he said . The recent attempt by Jacobs Suchard AG & lt ; JACZ . Z > to take over Hero Conserven Lenzburg & lt ; HERZ .

1371,"BALLY & lt ; BLY > SEEN SELLING OFF HEALTH UNIT Bally Manufacturing Corp ' s proposed public offering of 24 pct of its Health and Tennis Corp unit is seen as the first step towards the sale of the entire unit , analysts said . "" In the longer - term horizon , Bally wants to concentrate on its gaming businesses ,"" said analyst Dennis Forst of Seidler Amdec Securities Inc . Last week , Bally said it was considering the sale of another non - casino unit , its Six Flags amusement park unit , which analysts said could fetch about 300 mln dlrs . Bally spokesman Bill Peltier said "" the company currently has no hard plans to the sell any more of the health club company , but in the long term we ' ll wait and see how the offering goes ."" Once Bally ' s biggest revenue producer , the health club unit had 1986 operating income of 60 mln dlrs on revenues of 456 . 2 mln dlrs , 28 pct of Bally ' s revenues . Analysts estimate the unit could be sold for for 300 - 500 mln dlrs . Analysts said Bally ' s decision to offer shares in the unit could be the first step to selling it . "" It would seem obvious that an offering would decrease the health club unit ' s debt , increase its cash flow and operating income , making it an attractive buy to a third party ,"" Steven Eisenberg of Bear Stearns said . On Monday , Bally said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial offering of 24 pct , or 5 . 8 mln shares , of the unit ' s common stock at 13 - 15 dlrs a share . About half the proceeds , 40 mln dlrs , will be used to reduce parent Bally Manufacturing ' s debt which has swelled to 1 . 6 billion dlrs due to recent hotel acquisitions and the purchase of shares from Donald Trump who had threatened a hostile takeover , according to Bally treasurer Paul Johnson . Remaining proceeds from the stock offering and from a separate offering of 50 mln dlrs of 20 - year convertible subordinated debt would be used to repay about 75 mln dlrs of short term senior bank debt of the health chain unit , a Bally spokesperson said . Analysts said Bally ' s health club unit ' s profits have remained strong , but are skeptical about the industry ' s long range prospects . "" The fitness club industry , over the last 10 years , has grown tremendously , but the question is whether its a fad or a permanent part of our lifestyle ,"" said Eisenberg of Bear Stearns . Analysts said fitness clubs will likely flourish if the public stays at its peak of health consciousness , but that overcapacity is likely to occur as consumer enthusiasm wanes . In addition , "" the returns in the fitness club industry are just not as high as they are in the gaming industry ,"" said one analyst . There are about 6 , 500 fitness clubs in the U . S ., excluding clubs run by not - for - profit organizations , according to the Association of Physical Fitness Centers who estimates it to be an 8 . 0 - billion - dlr - a - year industry . Asked if anyone has offered to buy the unit , which is the nation ' s largest health club chain , Peltier said , "" no one has the money to offer to buy it ."" "" The fitness industry is a fragmented industry with no leader and there is a great opportunity for growth through acquisition and then standardization ,"" said Wayne LaChapelle , chief financial officer of Livingwell INc & lt ; WELL >, the nation ' s second largest fitness chain operator whih LaChapelle said Livingwell is always interested in acquisition opportunities but "" could not afford an acquisition the size of Bally at this time ."""

The presidential office and Ariadne representatives in Manila were not available for comment on the report . The shares are the entire block seized by the government from the United Coconut Planters Bank ( UCPB ) on suspicion that the real owner was Eduardo Cojuangco , the former chairman of San Miguel and UCPB and a close associate of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos . The 38 mln shares consist of 24 mln class A stock and 14 mln class B shares . Government officials have said earlier that the more valuable class A shares would not be sold to foreigners .

1399,"DART GROUP FLEXIBLE ON SUPERMARKETS & lt ; SGL > BID & lt ; Dart Group Corp > said it told Supermarkets General Corp & lt ; SGL > it was flexible on the price it would pay to acquire the company . Dart has said it would offer 41 . 75 dlrs cash for each SGL share if the SGL board recommended the offer to shareholders . SGL has termed the 1 . 62 billion dlr offer unsolicited . In a letter to SGL dated March 20 , Dart also said it was denied confidential information on SGL that would be given to other potential bidders . SGL officials could not be reached for comment . Dart said it was advised that a selling brochure for the sale of SGL had been distributed to about 20 potential buyers , but not itself . These purchasers would also be given access to SGL ' s books and records and the opportunity to talk with key employees . "" We suspect that one or more of the 20 are leveraged buyout firms ,"" said a source close to Dart . Analysts have said SGL management may be considering a leveraged buyout . Dart said it remains interested in acquiring SGL on a friendly basis and reiterated its willingness to negotiate all the terms of its offer . Dart said SGL representatives said the company has not received any other offer . It said it requested the confidential information to better understand SGL , but was denied this because it refused to sign an agreement prohibiting it from making a bid for SGL without SGL ' s approval . The agreement would also have limited its ability to buy SGL shares , Dart said . It considered those conditions unreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendly transaction , it said . Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares . Dart said it requested the information before its meeting with SGL representatives , but held the meetings in the hope representatives would reach an agreement . It said it indicated it was flexible on price , but was told there were certain issues important to SGL management and while they were not conditions to the deal , Dart was expected to take them into account in putting together its package . It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5 . 7 mln dlrs to SGL chairman Leonard Lieberman , executive vice president James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine . Dart said this payment was intended for the three officers ' severance agreements , although there was an implication that Lieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of their own volition . Dart said under their present agreements , none of these officers have any right to such accelerated payments . Also , Dart said Lieberman , Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2 . 6 mln dlrs to pay their taxes . It also said top management ' s incentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a cost of six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the shares unless waived by the company ' s compensation committee . Dart said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for top management ' s supplemental retirement plan . Dart said another issue was to agree to future severance obligations and future salary guarantees for top management , estimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligations under the company ' s present policy . Dart said despite such management payments , it agreed to discuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try to negotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with SGL . Supermarkets General owns the Path Mark supermarket chain and Rickels home centres . Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filed by an SGL shareholder , seeking to stop SGL from taking such actions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence . The suit also sought to have directors carry out their fiduciary duty . Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by an unwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue of securities to shareholders which make a takeover more expensive ."

Ferruzzi is one of several groups bidding to buy all of Corn Products ' installations in Europe .

However , Wendy ' s remained up 5 / 8 at 12 - 3 / 8 on volume of more than three mln shares . Several analysts were skeptical of the rumors , yet they said they could not conclude a takeover of the fast food restaurant chain was impossible . Wendy ' s declined comment on takeover rumors of all kinds . Yet , a Wendy ' s spokesman said the company was aware of a Business Week article , which named Coke as a potential suitor and which market sources said helped ignite the rumor mill . Market sources mentioned Anheuser - Busch Inc & lt ; BUD > and Pepsico Inc & lt ; PEP > as alternatives to Coke as acquirers . Neither of those companies would comment , nor would the Wendy ' s official . "" It doesn ' t happen every day , every week , every month , but its not unusual for us to be linked with those companies ,"" said Denny Lynch , Wendy ' s vice president of communications . However , Lynch would not comment specifically on the current market rumors . Even before Coke denied the rumors , analysts had been skeptical of a takeover since Atlanta - based Coke has stated it views fast food chains as customers and does not want to become a competitor to them . "" I can ' t put another name on it ,"" said Kidder peabody analyst Jay Freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold up Wendy ' s stock . "" It very well could be someone ' s interested .""

Wendy ' s , the third largest fast food hamburger chain in the U . S ., lost about 11 pct in same store sales last year , analysts said .

Some analysts said the company should be bringing in new products , but it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround . There are analysts , however , who believe Wendy ' s may be vulnerable to a takeover . James Murren of C . J . Lawrence said Wendy ' s could be worth 14 to 15 dlrs on a break - up basis . He said the company has improved its debt - to - equity ratio and Wendy ' s owns a high percent of its own restaurants - 38 pct of 3 , 500 . "" They also have some attractive leaseholds on their restaurants ,"" Murren said . Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year , Wendy ' s real sales , store for store , turned upwards in the fourth quarter . "" That was about the first time in seven quarters ,"" he said . Caroline Levy of E . F . Hutton also believes something could be going on with Wendy ' s . "" My gut feeling is something ' s going to happen . I don ' t know what ,"" she said . She estimated a takeover price would be at least 15 dlrs per share . One analyst speculated that Coke became the rumored suitor because Wendy ' s decided to sell Coke at its fountains instead of Pepsi .

1454,"SEC PROBES 1986 TRE & lt ; TRE > TAKEOVER ATTEMPT The federal Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is looking for possible securities laws violations in connection with an unsuccessful 1986 bid by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman to take over TRE Corp , attorneys contacted by SEC investigators said . During the takeeover attempt , a unit of Sugarman ' s Giant Group Ltd at one point held a 9 . 9 pct stake in TRE . It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc , a Los Angeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on a portion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired . In addition , a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mln dlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc with help from Jefferies , and used a portion of the proceeds to buy TRE stock . Finally , Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly six pct of TRE , according to an SEEC filing . The attorneys , who asked not to be identified , said the SEC was investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TRE holdings were working together without disclosing their cooperation , as would be required by the federal securities laws . One attorney said SEC probers also were examining whether Sugarman and Drexel had made adequate disclosures of its intended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mln dlr bond offering . A TRE spokesman confirmed that TRE , since December a unit of Aluminum Co of America , had been contacted by SEC investigators and was cooperating with the probe . The spokesman added that TRE Chairman Leopold Wyler had been interviewed by the SEC probers . A Jefferies spokesman said the SEC had asked for information a few months ago as part of an informal probe . The spokesman said Jefferies had cooperated with the agency and had heard nothing more since that time . "" To the best of our knowledge , Jefferies is not the target of a formal SEC investigation "" in connection with the TRE bid , he said . A Drexel spokesman acknowledged that his firm had underwritten the debt offering for Sugarman but added : "" We had nothing to do with TRE .""

A statement by Williams said it was confident of the merits of the proposed merger and it had therefore taken care to propose from the outset the right terms , including a full cash alternative . The offer will include a partial convertible alternative under which shareholders would receive up to a total of 205 . 69 mln new second convertible shares in Williams instead of their ordinary share allocations . The offer for Norcros preferential shares offers one Williams preferential share for each one of Norcros , for a value of 130p each and a total of 2 . 9 mln stg . Last week Williams reported that pretax profits for 1986 rose to 22 . 9 mln stg from 6 . 3 mln .

The convertible offer would be on the basis of four Williams convertibles for every Norcros share , worth 428p a share . The cash alternative would offer the equivalent of 400 . 2p a share . The announcement of the bid pushed Williams share price down to 733p from last night ' s close at 750p .

Brazil ' s coffee chief Jorio Dauster said yesterday Brazil would not change its coffee policies .

He said according to ICO statistics there was a shortfall of nine mln ( 60 - kg ) bags on the world market between October , the start of the coffee year , and February ."
2,"KENYAN ECONOMY FACES PROBLEMS , PRESIDENT SAYS The Kenyan economy is heading for difficult times after a boom last year , and the country must tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging too far into deficit , President Daniel Arap Moi said . In a speech at the state opening of parliament , Moi said high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth of five pct , compared with 4 . 1 pct in 1985 . The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of payments surplus and inflation fell to 5 . 6 pct from 10 . 7 pct in 1985 , he added . "" But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a result , we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange reserves during the year ,"" he said . The price of coffee , Kenya ' s main source of foreign exchange , fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a peak of 2 . 14 dlrs in January 1986 . Crude oil , which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a barrel , has since crept back to over 18 dlrs . Moi said the price changes , coupled with a general decline in the flow of capital from the rest of the world , made it more difficult to finance the government ' s budget deficit . Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of capital for the first time in its history , he added . "" This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult phase as regards our external debts , and it is imperative that we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign sources to finance our development ,"" he said . "" It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on expenditure ... And members of this house will have to take the lead in encouraging wananchi ( ordinary people ) to be more frugal in satisfying immediate needs ,"" the president added ."
3,"INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP India is searching for non - communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange . Wheat , tobacco , tea , coffee , jute , engineering and electronic goods , as well as minerals including iron ore , are all on offer in return for crude oil , petroleum products , chemicals , steel and machinery , trade sources told Reuters . Most of the impetus behind countertrade , which began in 1984 , comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp ( STC ) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp ( MMTC ). "" The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports ,"" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said , adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading . One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports . However , countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India ' s total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18 . 53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December , the sources said . Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India ' s 25 . 65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985 / 86 ended March , against almost nothing in 1984 / 85 , official figures show . However , the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non - convertible Indian rupees , the sources said . Total trade with the Soviet Union , involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil , is estimated at 3 . 04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986 / 87 , against three billion in 1985 / 86 . Indian countertrade , which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country ' s large trade deficit , is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia , Venezuela and Brazil , the trade sources said . The trade deficit , which hit an estimated record 6 . 96 billion dlrs in 1985 / 86 , is expected to decline to 5 . 6 billion in the current fiscal year . But the push to include non - communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors , including the slow growth of foreign reserves , a tight debt repayment schedule , shrinking aid and trade protectionism , businessmen said . One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past , when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules . As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ), India cannot officially support bartering . The MMTC ' s recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails . "" MMTC ' s recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India ,"" a trade official said , adding that the policy remains flexible . "" We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India ,"" the trade official said . Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft , ships , drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return , the trade sources said . Illustrating the point , the official said a South Korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state - run Oil and Natural Gas Commission . In return , the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy Indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract , against the 25 pct sought by New Delhi , the trade official said . "" We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest ,"" he added . Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign currency to import goods . India has signed a trade protocol to buy up to 15 , 000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in exchange for Indian goods , including jute bags and cars . But despite India ' s new drive , countertrade has some inherent problems , they added . "" It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that the trade should always be balanced ,"" one trade source said . "" The other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy commodities which the other party wants ."" Another added , "" Barter is also restrictive . We look upon it as a temporary measure to get over the current balance of payments difficulty . "" This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India . It does not even figure in the country ' s foreign trade policy ."""

6,"COFFEE PRICES BAD NEWS FOR LATIN AMERICA - MINISTER A senior Nicaraguan official said a recent plunge in coffee prices was economically and politically disastrous for Latin American coffee - producing countries . Nicaraguan Foreign Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca was in London to brief International Coffee Organisation ( ICO ) executive board producer members after a meeting last weekend in Managua attended by eight Latin American coffee producers to discuss the fall in coffee prices . London coffee prices slid 300 stg per tonne in March , to 1 , 279 stg from 1 , 580 stg at end - February . Martinez told reporters the price fall since the ICO failed to agree export quotas on March 1 has had disastrous results on Latin America , both economically and politically . He urged continued negotiations among coffee producers to pave the way for a coffee export quota agreement by September . Coffee export quotas , used to regulate coffee prices under an International Coffee Agreement , were suspended a year ago when prices soared in response to a drought in Brazil . Central American economic ministers have estimated the region will lose 720 mln dlrs in foreign exchange earnings in 1987 if coffee prices are not rescued by a quota arrangement , Martinez said . He said ICO quota talks broke down last month because consumer members lack the political will to fully support commodity agreements , and because consumers tried to dictate to producers ."

9,"COFFEE TALKS COLLAPSE EASES NEED FOR U . S . BILL The collapse of International Coffee Organization , ICO , talks on export quotas yesterday removes the immediate need to reinstate U .

The Reagan administration proposed in trade legislation offered Congress last month that authority to monitor coffee imports be resumed . That authority lapsed in September 1986 . A bill also was introduced by Rep . Frank Guarini ( D - N . J .). However , the failure of the ICO talks in London to reach agreement on export quotas means the U .

10,"U . S . SEES NO NEW COFFEE AGREEMENT TALKS SOON The United States does not expect the executive board meeting of the International Coffee Organization , ICO , to call for a new round of negotiations on reinstating coffee quotas , a U . S . government official said . The official , a member of the U . S . delegation to ICO talks earlier this year , said no new coffee agreement talks are expected because there is no indication the negotiating positions of major producers and consumers have changed . The U . S . still demands , as a condition of reimposition of coffee quotas , that "" objective criteria "" be set for establishing quotas , said the U . S . official , who asked not to be identified . Brazil , the major producer , insists on quotas based on a traditional formula . The U . S . remains open to a negotiating meeting but only if some new flexibility is apparent from major countries , the official said . The ICO executive board meets tomorrow in London ."
11,"ICO BOARD SEEN UNLIKELY TO SET NEW COFFEE TALKS Chances that the International Coffee Organization , ICO , executive board meeting this week will agree to resume negotiations on export quotas soon look remote , ICO delegates and trade sources said . ICO observers doubted Brazil or key consuming countries are ready to give sufficient ground to convince the other side that reopening negotiations again would be worthwhile , they said . ICO talks on quotas last month broke down after eight days when producers and consumers failed to reach agreement . "" Since we have not seen signs of change in other positions , it ' s difficult to see a positive outcome at this stage ,"" Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said . But quotas must be negotiated sometime , he said . The U . S . has indicated it is open to dialogue on quotas but that Brazil must be flexible , rather than refuse to lower its export share as it did in the last negotiations , delegates said . At this week ' s March 31 - April 2 meeting , the 16 - member ICO board is scheduled to discuss the current market situation , the reintroduction of quotas , verification of stocks and some administrative matters , according to a draft agenda . The fact that Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster , Assistant U . S . Trade Representative Jon Rosenbaum and chief Colombian delegate Jorge Cardenas are not attending the meeting has signalled to most market watchers that it will be a non - event as far as negotiating quotas is concerned . "" I would imagine there will be a lot of politicking among producers behind closed doors to work up some kind of proposal by September ( the next scheduled council meeting ),"" Bronwyn Curtis of Landell Mills Commodities Studies said . Traders and delegates said they have seen no sign that a date will be set for an earlier council meeting . If the stalemate continues much longer , analysts expect the coffee agreement will end up operating without quotas for the remainder of its life , to September 30 , 1989 . When talks broke down , the U . S . and Brazil , the largest coffee consumer and producer respectively , blamed one another for sabotaging negotiations by refusing to compromise . Brazil wanted to maintain the previous export quota shares , under which it was allocated 30 pct of world coffee exports , but consumers and a small group of producers pressed for shares to be redistributed using "" objective criteria ,"" which would have threatened Brazil ' s share . At a recent meeting in Managua of Latin American producers , Costa Rica and Honduras said they were willing to put their objections as members of the group of eight ICO "" dissident "" producers aside , in order to stem the damaging decline in prices , Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca told reporters Saturday . He was in London to brief producers on the Managua meeting . However , other producers said they were not aware of this move toward producer solidarity . London coffee prices closed at 1 , 276 stg a tonne today , down from around 1 , 550 at the beginning of March ."

They said IBC President Jorio Dauster is likely to leave the basic formula for the minimum registration price unchanged but raise the contribution quota to partially offset the effects of cruzado devaluation since April registrations were closed in mid - February . To fully compensate for devaluation the quota would have to be around 28 dlrs per bag against 7 . 0 when registrations closed . However , even a 21 dlr per bag rise in the contribution quota would make Brazil coffees uncompetitive on world markets , and an increase to around 15 dlrs a bag is more likely , the exporters said . They added that Dauster is keen to raise the contribution quota as the Institute needs money to repay Central Governmnet funds released to finance IBC purchases at the guaranteed producer price . Although a vote in the Monetary Council to provide more funds for such purchases was deferred on technical grounds last week , funds are still being released for subsequent approval . The sources said it is still unclear when registrations will be reopened , although most expect it to be by the end of this week . "" Brazil owes it to its customers to make its intentions know . A country like Brazil cannot afford to be permanently closed down ,"" one exporter said . However , before announcing its export policy the IBC is likely to wait to see if tomorrow ' s meeting of the International Coffee Organisation , ICO , executive board in London decides to call a full council meeting to discuss reintroduction of export quotas , sources said . There is also talk of the announcement this week of new measures to adjust the Brazilian economy , and the IBC could be awaiting clarification before making any move , the exporters said . Another factor which could be delaying the opening of registrations is the current strike by bank workers which , while not affecting current shipments , could affect documentation and currency operations for new sales . This would certainly be the case if the IBC was considering obliging exporters to pay the contribution quota within two or three days of registering a sale ."
13,"INDIA REDUCES EXPORT DUTY ON COFFEE India cut the export duty on coffee to 330 rupees per 100 kg from 600 rupees , effective March 23 , a Coffee Board official said . The reduction should help India reach its coffee export target of 90 , 000 tonnes in fiscal 1987 / 88 ending March 31 , against provisionally estimated exports of 75 , 000 tonnes in 1986 / 87 and an actual 99 , 254 tonnes in 1985 / 86 , he said . India is likely to press for international export quotas at a meeting of coffee producers in London this week because of depressed prices , he added . The International Coffee Organisation , which represents both consumers and producers , has so far failed to reach agreement on quotas . India feels it will be useful to have quotas now because the slide in prices is unlikely to be halted immediately , he said . Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market prices surged after a drought devastated Brazil ' s coffee crop ."
14,"COMMODITY PACTS MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS MARKET Consuming countries , chastened by the collapse of International Tin Council ( ITC ) price support operations in 1985 , are insisting more than ever before that commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are serving , a Reuter survey showed . They want price ranges to be more responsive to market trends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining the accords ' support operations - and intervention rules that avoid the risk of exports by non - members undermining the pacts . Consumers and producers , mindful of ITC buffer stock losses , have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations . Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and prefer to assess each commodity case by case , the survey showed . The International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) last week set precise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager ( BSM ) could do under the new agreement . It imposed daily and weekly purchase limits , prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets and stipulated , after consumer insistence , that up to 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases could be of non - member cocoa . This will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia , the world ' s fourth largest producer , undermining the market . The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades . A new International Natural Rubber Agreement ( INRA ) was adopted earlier this month in Geneva . Importing and exporting countries agreed several changes to make the reference price more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance operations . Direct cash contributions from members will fund buffer stock purchases . Bank financing was a particular feature of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling . Legal wrangles continue . Recent International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) negotiations in London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that agreements reflect market reality , commodity analysts said . Consumers and a small group of producers argued that "" objective criteria "" should be used to define export quota shares , which would have meant a reduction in the share of Brazil , the world ' s leading producer . Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of 30 pct . The talks broke down and , although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today , delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term negotiations on export quota distribution as remote . International agreements exist for sugar and wheat . These do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for discussions on possible future economic agreements , collect statistics and draw up market analyses . Analysts said differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any progress towards an accord with economic teeth , while sheer competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat . An alternative focus for commodity discussions are international study groups , made up of governments with advice from industry , such as those for lead and zinc and rubber . The U . N . Common fund for commodities , with a planned directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs , has failed to become operational because neither the U . S . Nor the Soviet Union has ratified it . U . S . Officials in Washington said the U . S . Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives , citing the lack of widespread support . U . S . Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in Kuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity pact case by case . U . S . Officials said it has been willing to study individual cases for economically sound , market - oriented commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests . "" We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the price of a commodity whose long - term trend is downward ,"" official Administration policy states . The U . S . Currently belongs to only two international commodity agreements that have economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement ( ICA ) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat pacts . The U . S . Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries , the State Department said . U . S . Officials singled out the INRA as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working . U . S . Negotiators were successful in getting other members of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect market trends and also to continue the accord as a market oriented agreement , U . S . Officials said . Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on the merits of each case . Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country , the world ' s top producer of rubber , tin and palm oil , decides its participation in international commodity pacts case by case . Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing Countries ( ATPC ) which produce 65 pct of world tin . The ATPC launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96 , 000 tonnes for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50 , 000 from 70 , 000 . Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and delegate to cocoa , wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told Reuters in London , "" Agreements with economic clauses to stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were close to market reality , if there was full participation by producers and consumers , and if participants were prepared to take their obligations in the framework of the agreement seriously ."" But Baron added , "" No real sanctions are available for a country that doesn ' t stick to its obligations ... The German approach is sceptical . We don ' t think agreements are the best instrument to help developing countries . They were never meant to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how developing countries often interpret them ."" Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of commodity agreements , reflecting its strong links with Third World producing countries . But recently demands for more stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the need for "" intellectual honesty "" and "" objective criteria "" have grown . British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid . It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree of transparency and do not contain the risk of open - ended borrowing that occurred in the tin pact , they said . U . K . Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather than dictate what prices should be . A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price realism in commodity pacts , adding high prices inflate supply . A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable to commodity pacts . France , a large consumer and producer of sugar , favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real market situation , particularly regarding stocks . Indonesia ' s Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told Reuters in Jakarta : "" These agreements can work as long as the problems are cyclical .. But it ' s another matter when there are structural problems .. But we are still committed to commodity agreements as an act of faith ."" Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity agreements . "" The political will is not there on the part of some consumers to make agreements work ,"" Martinez Cuenca said . The head of the economics department in the Brazilian Foreign Ministry , Sebastiao do Rego Barros , told Reuters an agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market reality . If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system of quotas , with a link between prices practised inside the pact and actual market prices , it can work . UNCTAD spokesman Graham Shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings enhance developing countries ' ability to service debt and mean greater demand for industrialised nations ' capital goods ."
15,"ICO BOARD PASSES OVER COFFEE QUOTA ISSUE Executive board members of the International Coffee Organization , ICO , passed over the issue of export quota negotiations at its regular meeting here , delegates said . No move was made to reopen dialogue on export quotas and no further discussion on the issue is likely during the three - day talks , they said . Producer and consumer members of the ICO council failed to agree export quota shares in early March . Neither Brazil , the largest producer , nor the U . S ., the largest consumer , are ready to be flexible , delegates said . "" The situation is unchanged ,"" consumer spokesman Abraham Van Overbeeke told reporters . "" As long as Brazil sticks to its position there will not be quotas -- there is no point in meeting ."" At the last council meeting , Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of around 30 pct of the market . Consumers and a splinter group of eight producers favoured redistribution of export shares using "" objective criteria ,"" which would likely have reduced Brazil ' s share . Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said that , if quota negotiations were to resume , the 1 . 0 mln bag shortfall Brazil was willing to give up in early March if the producer proposal was accepted would no longer be on the table . "" As we said from the start ... No agreement , no one million bags ,"" he told Reuters . Shortfalls of 200 , 000 bags offered by OAMCAF , the African and Malagasy Coffee Organization , and 20 , 000 bags offered by Angola , are also no longer valid , delegates said . The closest the board came to discussing quotas was a briefing by the Guatemalan ICO delegate Rene Montes on a recent Latin American producers meeting in Managua , delegates said . There , the producers expressed their political will to negotiate basic quotas , particularly in the face of the damaging drop in coffee prices after the council failed to agree quotas , Montes said . The ICO board also reviewed export statistics and stock verification . They expected talks on stock verification to take up the remainder of today ' s session , delegates said ."
16,"CSCE RESTRUCTURES COFFEE FUTURES DAILY LIMITS The Coffee , Sugar and Cocoa Exchange has expanded the normal daily trading limit in Coffee "" C "" contracts to 6 . 0 cents a lb , from the previous 4 . 0 cents , effective today , the CSCE said . The new daily limits apply to all but the two nearby positions , currently May and July , which trade without limits . In addition , the 6 . 0 cent limit can be increased to 9 . 0 cents a lb if the first two limited months both make limit moves in the same direction for two consecutive sessions , according to the CSCE announcement . Before the rule change today , the CSCE required two days of limit moves in the first three restricted contracts before expanding the daily trading limit . Under new guidelines , if the first two restricted deliveries move the 6 . 0 cent limit for two days the Exchange will expand the limit . The expanded 9 . 0 cent limit will remain in effect until the settling prices on both of the first two limited months has not moved by more than the normal 6 . 0 cent limit for other contracts in two successive trading sessions , the CSCE said ."
17,"GUATEMALA TO HOST OTHER MILDS COFFEE MEETING Guatemala will host a meeting of other milds coffee producers probably in May to discuss basic export quotas , the Guatemalan delegate to the International Coffee Organization , ICO , said . No firm date has been set for the talks , Ambassador Rene Montes told reporters at the ICO executive board meeting here . Producer countries Brazil , Colombia , and a member of OAMCAF , the African and Malagasy Coffee Organization , may also be invited for consultation , he said . ICO producers and consumers could not agree on how to calculate export quota shares at a recent council meeting here . Other milds coffee producers include Costa Rica , Dominican Republic , Ecuador , El Salvador , Guatemala , Honduras , India , Mexico , Nicaragua , Papua New Guinea , and Peru ."
18,"CSCE ALTERS RULES ON TRADING LIMITS The Coffee , Sugar and Cocoa Exchange amended regulations governing expanded trading limits on coffee , cocoa and sugar contracts to provide uniformity . Effective today , the exchange will permit normal daily price limits in those commodities to expand whenever the first two limited contract months move the limit in the same direction for two consecutive sessions . The normal daily limits will be reinstated once the first two limited deliveries close by less than the normal limit for two successive trading days . Previously exchange rules required the first three limited months to move the limit in coffee and cocoa . It had required the first two limited sugar deliveries to make such moves for three consecutive sessions ."

20,"ICO COFFEE PRODUCERS TO DISCUSS MARKET SITUATION International Coffee Organization , ICO , producers will meet at 1500 GMT ( 0900 est ) for a general discussion of the market situation , producer spokesman Lindenberg Sette said . The Brazilian delegate said several producers requested the meeting but Brazil was not among them . The ICO executive board ' s regular session this week has so far been confined to routine matters , with no attempt by producers or consumers to revive export quota negotiations , delegates said . Talks to restore quotas collapsed early last month when producers and consumers failed to resolve differences on how quotas should be allocated . Producer delegates said there was no sense of urgency among producers to reopen quota talks with consumers , with most countries now prepared to wait for the ICO ' s annual September council session to restart negotiations . Members of the Inter - African Coffee Organization called for today ' s producer meeting to exchange views on the market situation , the producer delegates said . The lack of a new debate on export quotas here this week was cited as the reason for renewed weakness in coffee prices in London and New York futures , traders said . Near May in London hit a five - year low this morning at 1 , 220 stg , about 50 stg below last night ' s close , they said . The executive board session looks set to end today , following a final session at 1600 GMT ( 1000 est ) when a consultancy report of the operation of the ICO will be presented to producers and consumers , delegates added ."
21,"KENYAN MINISTER FORECASTS ECONOMIC EXPANSION Kenya ' s economy will continue to expand this year and the government will do more to encourage investment by foreign firms and the local private sector , Planning Minister Robert Ouko said . He told a news conference that the government would soon create a special bureau to expedite processing of investment applications by local and foreign investors . Praising the role of multinational companies and local entrepreneurs in Kenya ' s economy , the minister promised to maintain a close working contact with the private sector . The economy grew by 5 . 3 pct last year , up from 4 . 1 pct in 1985 , Ouko said . This was owing to high prices for the country ' s coffee exports , low oil prices , low inflation and rising real incomes , he added . "" Despite rising petroleum prices and falling coffee prices , Kenya ' s economy is still expected to improve in 1987 ,"" the planning minister said . "" High aggregate demand arising from low inflation , trade liberalisation and disciplined financial management are expected to increase output in the manufacturing sector ,"" he said . Agriculture would expand significantly if favourable weather continued and farmers responded to producer price rises announced in February , the minister added . Kenyan farmers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the long rainy season , which is due to start about now . Ouko said the production of Kenya ' s main cash crops increased during the second half of last year . Coffee deliveries to the state - run Coffee Board of Kenya rose 17 pct and tea deliveries rose four pct during the period , he said . Ouko paid tribute to the private sector for its contribution to the economy and promised to improve government cooperation with businessmen by maintaining regular contact with them . "" I wish to pay tribute to the private sector for its contribution to the economy in 1986 and challenge it to maintain the same spirit this year ... The manufacturing sector grew by an estimated 5 . 8 pct in 1986 , in line with the same period the previous year ,"" he said . Ouko said the "" one stop "" bureau was intended to stimulate investment and cut the time and bureacracy currently involved in processing applications . The planning minister presented a review of the Kenyan economy during the second half of 1986 which showed inflation falling to 4 . 3 pct from 10 . 2 a year earlier . This was owing to higher agricultural production and the Kenyan shilling ' s relative strength against other major currencies , the report said . The average exchange rate was 16 . 23 shillings per U . S . Dlr last year , a fall of only 1 . 2 pct from 16 . 432 in 1985 . The half yearly report said exports increased about 30 pct in July - December 1986 , while imports rose by only six pct during the period . This gave Kenya an overall balance of payments surplus of 780 mln Kenya shillings ( 48 mln dlrs ) during the period , compared with a 1 . 4 billion shilling ( 87 mln dlr ) deficit in the second half of 1985 , it said ."

23,RESTORATION OF COFFEE EXPORT QUOTAS BEFORE OCTOBER SEEMS UNLIKELY - ICO PRODUCER DELEGATES RESTORATION OF COFFEE EXPORT QUOTAS BEFORE OCTOBER SEEMS UNLIKELY - ICO PRODUCER DELEGATES
24,"ICO QUOTAS BEFORE OCTOBER UNLIKELY - DELEGATES The restoration of coffee export quotas before the end of the current 1986 / 87 coffee year ( Oct 1 / Sept 30 ) now seems unlikely , given reluctance by International Coffee Organization , ICO , producers and consumers to resume negotiations on an interim quota accord , producer delegates told reporters . Consumers and most producers see no point in reopening the quota dialogue while Brazil ' s position remains unchanged , they said . Brazil ' s refusal to accept a reduction in its previous 30 pct share of the ICO ' s global export quota effectively torpedoed talks here last month aimed at restoring quotas before October , the delegates noted . Disappointment at the lack of progress on quotas forced coffee futures in London and New York to new lows today , traders here said . Near May in New York fell below one dlr in early trading at around 99 . 10 cents per pound , traders said . Producer delegates said that while the possibility of reimposing quotas before October remained on the ICO agenda , in practice the idea had effectively been discarded . The ICO ' s executive board session here this week has so far barely touched on the quota debate , demonstrating general unwillingness to revive talks while chances of success are still remote , producer delegates said . Some producers are in no hurry to see quotas restored , despite the price collapse seen since the failure of last month ' s negotiations , they said . "" With Brazil ' s frost season approaching , who wants to negotiate quotas ,"" one leading producer delegate said . Coffee prices normally rise during Brazil ' s frost season ( mainly June - August ) as dealers and roasters build up stocks as insurance against possible severe frost damage to Brazil ' s crop . Many producers are more interested in working towards reimposing quotas from October 1 , based on a new system of quota allocations valid until the International Coffee Agreement expires in 1989 , they said . Guatemala has already proposed the "" other oilds "" producer group should meet in the next two months to begin talks on how to allocate quota shares . Producers still seem divided on how to overhaul the quota distribution system , with some producer delegates reporting growing support for a radical reallocation , based on the principle of "" objective criteria "" favoured by consumers . At last month ' s council session a splinter group of small producers backed consumer demands for new quota shares based on exportable production and stocks , while Brazil , Colombia and the rest of the producers favoured leaving quota allocations unchanged , except for some temporary adjustments . A delegate from one of the eight said more producers now supported their cause . The delegate said unless major producers like Brazil showed readiness to negotiate new quota shares , prospects for a quota accord in October also looked bleak . The U . S . and most other consumers are still determined to make reimposition of quotas conditional on a redistribution of quota shares based on "" objective criteria ."" ICO observers remained sceptical that Brazil would be prepared to accept a quota reduction when the ICO council meets in September . Brazil has adopted a tough stance with banks on external debt negotiations and is likely to be just as tough on coffee , they said . They said Brazil ' s reluctance to open coffee export registrations might reflect fears this would provoke another price slide and force an emergency ICO council session , which would most likely end in failure . Producers met this afternoon to review the market situation but had only a general discussion about how further negotiations should proceed , a producer delegate said . Producers plan to hold consultations on quotas , and then may set a date for a formal producer meeting , but plans are not fixed , he said . The ICO executive board reconvened at 1650 hours local time to hear a report from consultants on ICO operations . The board meeting looks set to end today , a day earlier than scheduled , delegates said ."
25,"ICO PACT UNLIKELY BY AUTUMN - ITALIAN ADVISER The prospects of the International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) reaching an agreement on coffee export quotas before September appear dim , Alberto Hesse , former president of the European Coffee Federation , said . "" There is no real goodwill in certain delegations to go to quotas ,"" Hesse , who advises the Italian Foreign Affairs Ministry on coffee issues , told Reuters . He declined to name the delegations . A special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set quotas . The ICO executive board will meet from March 30 to April 1 but the full council is not due to meet again until September . "" I am not optimistic about an agreement soon ,"" Hesse said ."
26,"COLOMBIA TRADERS SAY NEW COFFEE STRATEGY VITAL Coffee producing countries must quickly map out a fresh common strategy following the failure of the International Coffee Organization , ICO , to reach agreement on export quotas , Gilberto Arango , president of Colombia ' s private coffee exporters ' association , said . Arango told Reuters that the most intelligent thing now would be to seek a unifying stand from producers , including Brazil , in order to map out a strategy to defend prices . An ICO special meeting ended last night in London with exporting and consuming nations failing to agree on a resumption of export quotas , suspended one year ago after prices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil . Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe but predicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedly plummet . However , he said the market should also take into account evident factors such as Brazil ' s low stocks and the sale of the near totality of the Central American crop . Trade sources said Colombia ' s coffee was today quoted at 1 . 14 dlrs a lb in New York , its second lowest price in the past 10 years . Cardenas said these countries apparently fail to understand the true impact of such a failure for coffee producing nations as well as for industrialized countries . It is difficult to believe that while efforts are made to solve the problem of the developing world ' s external debt , decisions are being taken which cut earnings used for repaying those debts , he said . "" In Colombia ' s case , we watch with consternation that , while we try to effectively combat drug trafficking , countries which support us in this fight seek to cut our jugular vein ,"" Cardenas said ."
27,"ICO TALKS SET TO END WITH NO QUOTA DEBATE The International Coffee Organization executive board meeting will end tomorrow without any move to reopen the debate on restoring coffee export quotas , delegates said .

Delegates earlier thought the meeting would end tonight , but a further session is scheduled tomorrow at 1030 GMT to complete reports on stock verification . Meantime , the executive board will meet May 12 to discuss possible action on the consultancy report on the ICO presented today to the board , consumer delegates said ."
28,"NY ANALYSTS SEE COFFEE FUTURES FALLING FURTHER New York coffee futures prices will probably fall to about 85 cents a lb in the next month before a consolidation trend sets in , according to market analysts . Yesterday , prices for the spot May contract fell below 1 . 00 dlr a lb for the first time since August 1981 after the International Coffee Organization did not place new export quota discussions on its current agenda . Talks aimed at renegotiating ICO export quotas , after five years of price - supporting agreements , broke down in February . "" Short - term , it looks like a definite test of 90 cents , perhaps 85 cents ,"" said William O ' Neill , coffee analyst with Elders Futures . "" But the additional downside may not be all that great from current levels ."" "" At this price level the market is very vulnerable to bullish developments ,"" O ' Neill added . "" Rather than us having a market that will plummet we ' ll kind of see prices erode -- probably to around 85 cents ."" "" I definitely see 90 cents and would not rule out a brief drop to 85 cents ,"" said Debra Tropp , a coffee analyst with Prudential Bache . But she said by June worries about a freeze in Brazil growing areas will become more of a market factor , with prices likely to consolidate ahead of that time . A trader at a major international trade house , who asked not to be named , said he expects a 10 cent drop near term but believes if Brazil opens May registrations at a relatively high export price and requires a high contribution quota from exporters the market could steady at the lower levels . Longer term , he added , producer pressure will mount on Brazil to agree to consumers ' export quota terms , and a new international agreement could come into force next fall . Since the February talks broke down , the market has fallen from about 130 . 00 cents a lb to a low of 98 . 10 cents a lb today , as buyers and sellers sought to reassess supply and demand . Generally , analysts say , producers have a large buildup of stocks , but U . S . roasters have drawn down supplies and will need to do some buying soon . "" Most producing nations have just completed or are about to complete their annual harvests and exportable supplies are at their seasonal peak . Exports remain behind year ago and warehouses in producer nations are becoming increasingly overburdened ,"" said Sandra Kaul , coffee analyst for Shearson Lehman , in that firm ' s forthcoming quarterly coffee report . Kaul said producers ' need to procure hard currency to service foreign debt will put further pressure on them to sell , and "" this should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices to six year lows ."" Kaul believes the market will drop to 80 cents a lb before Brazil ' s frost season begins in June . Accurate assessments of roaster demand are hard to come by , though analysts note the peak winter consumption period is passed and demand usually slows this time of year . Shearson ' s Kaul estimated U . S . roaster ending stocks as of January 31 , including soluble and roasted , at 6 . 3 mln bags compared with 6 . 9 mln at end - September 1986 , a small drawdown for the usually busy winter roasting season . But Elders O ' Neill said , "" The roasters are not overstocked by any means ."" Analysts said picking a bottom to the market is difficult , given the fact prices have fallen into uncharted territory below the long - term support at 1 . 00 dlr per lb , and several traders said the sidelines might be preferable for the short term ."
29,"COFFEE FUTURES AT SIX - YEAR LOW , UNDER 1 DLR / LB Coffee futures dipped further today and closed below 1 dlr a pound for the first time in six years . Coffee for delivery in May ended at 99 . 28 cents a pound on the Coffee , Sugar and Cocoa Exchange , down 0 . 76 cent and the lowest price since August , 1981 . Prices have been falling steadily since the International Coffee Organization failed in February to reach an agreement controlling exports by its members , and pressure was renewed this week as the executive board of the organization met in London without reopening debate on its export quotas . The executive board has limited its current discussions to administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday . Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1 . 30 dlr a pound in February , when the organization ' s discussions aimed at re - establishing export quotas broke down . Sandra Kaul , a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Brothers , said supplies currently are at their high point for the year because most producing nations have just completed their harvests . In addition , she said , many of those nations are faced with serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital . "" This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices ,"" she said . Further , U . S . demand could be sluggish because winter , the period of greatest consumption , is ending . Prices could fall another 10 cents to 15 cnts a pound , analysts said . Gold futures retreated from modest early gains and closed steady while silver prices rallied on the Commodity Exchange in New York . The increase in U . S . banks ' prime rates prompted concern about renewed inflation , but the strength of the U . S . dollar discouraged new buying .

In addition , she said , many of those nations are faced with serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital . "" This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices ,"" she said . Further , U . S . demand could be sluggish because winter , the period of greatest consumption , is ending . Prices could fall another 10 to 15 cents a pound , analysts said . Gold futures retreated from modest early gains and closed steady while silver prices rallied on the Commodity Exchange in New York . The increase in U . S . banks ' prime rates prompted concern about renewed inflation but the strength of the U . S . dollar discouraged new buying . "" The market is getting mixed signals and it doesn ' t know which way to go ,"" one analyst said . Cattle futures posted new highs on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , while live hogs rallied from early losses and frozen pork bellies finished sharply lower . Cattle prices continued to draw support from the winter storm that swept the Plains states , leaving animals stranded in snowbound fields and feed lots in miserable condition . Live hogs were pressured early by the Agriculture Department ' s report Tuesday that producers expanded their breeding herds more than the market expected last quarter . Prices recovered to keep pace with higher cash prices . Frozen pork bellies fell sharply on the outlook for greater production and closed with limit losses . Soybean futures posted sharp gains on the Chicago Board of Trade , while corn and wheat were lower . Soybeans rallied in response to Tuesday ' s USDA report that farmers intend to plant 56 . 9 mln acres this year , down from 61 . 5 mln planted last year . Corn prices were pressured by the outlook for 67 . 6 mln acres of corn , which is down from last year ' s 76 . 7 mln acres , but was larger than analysts expected ."
31,"THAI TRADERS OPPOSE REIMPOSITION OF COFFEE QUOTAS Thai coffee exporters said they hoped the International Coffee Organisation ( ICO ) would not reimpose export quotas even though this may lead to a further slump in world prices . Susin Suratanakaweekul , president of the Thai Coffee Exporters Association , told Reuters that Thailand obtained little benefit from previous ICO quotas which represented only about 30 pct of its total annual exports . Thailand expects increased overall coffee export revenue if there are no restrictions on sales to current ICO members who offer higher prices than non - members , he said . The Customs Department said Thailand exported 21 , 404 tonnes of coffee last year , up from 20 , 602 in 1985 . Thai coffee production is projected to fall to about 25 , 000 tonnes in the 1986 / 87 ( Oct / Sept ) season from 28 , 000 the previous year . However , a senior Commerce Ministry official said the Thai government supports coffee producers ' lobbying for reimposed ICO quotas which , he said , would help lift world prices . Somphol Kiatpaiboon , director general of the Commercial Economics Department , said an absence of ICO quotas would encourage producers to rapidly release coffee on to the market , further depressing prices . He said Indonesia is expected to export a substantial amount of coffee this month without such restrictions ."
32,"KENYAN COFFEE NEEDS RAIN , TRADERS SAY Kenya ' s late coffee crop is flowering well , but the main coffee areas were generally dry and hot in the week ended Wednesday , trade sources said . "" Machakos , Embu , Meru and Kirinyaga in eastern Kenya , and Nyeri and Thika in central , have been dry in the past week . The farmers expect rain this week . If it does not fall output of the late ( October - November - December ) crop will decline sharply ,"" one source said . He said that since most growers did not irrigate their crop they could do nothing but wait for rain , the main factor which determines Kenyan coffee production . Two months ago the International Coffee Organization issued a forecast of Kenyan exportable coffee production in the 1986 / 87 ( Oct - Sept ) season at 1 . 82 mln bags ."

34,"PERU COFFEE CROP UNAFFECTED BY RAINS Recent heavy rains have not affected the Peru coffee crop and producers are looking forward to a record harvest , the president of one of Peru ' s four coffee cooperative groups said . Justo Marin Ludena , president of the Cafe Peru group of cooperatives which accounts for about 20 pct of Peru ' s exports , told Reuters a harvest of up to 1 , 800 , 000 quintales ( 46 kilos ) was expected this year . He said Peru exported 1 , 616 , 101 quintales in the year to September 1986 . A spokesman for the Villa Rica cooperative said flood waters last month had not reached coffee plantations , and the crop was unaffected . Floods in early February caused extensive damage in Villa Rica , whose coffee cooperative exported 59 , 960 quintales last year , according to the state - controlled coffee organisation . Marin said the rains would only affect the coffee crop if they continued through to next month , when harvesting starts . He said Peruvian producers were hoping for an increase this year in the 1 . 3 pct export quota , about 913 , 000 quintales , assigned to them by the International Coffee Organisation , ICO . He said Peru exported 1 , 381 , 009 quintales to ICO members last year with a value of around 230 mln dlrs , and another 235 , 092 quintales , valued at around 35 mln dlrs , to non - ICO members ."

39,"COFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS Coffee prices may have to fall even lower to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the negotiating table to discuss export quotas , ICO delegates and traders said . The failure last night of International Coffee Organization , ICO , producing and consuming countries to agree export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee futures markets today with the London May price reaching a 4 - 1 / 2 year low at one stage of 1 , 270 stg per tonne before ending the day at 1 , 314 stg , down 184 stg from the previous close . The New York May price was down 15 . 59 at 108 . 00 cents a lb . Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices , some senior traders said . The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114 . 66 cents a lb for March 2 . This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in February last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop . In a Reuter interview , Brazilian Coffee Institute , IBC , President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions . "" If we have failed at the ICO , at least we have tried ,"" Dauster said , adding "" now it is time to go and sell coffee ."" But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open . It plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month , Dauster said . It is too difficult to forecast now . Trade sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a previous crop of 11 . 2 mln . Brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on London ' s futures market last year . A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market "" in one go "" but is sold over a minimum of six months . The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas . Consumers said "" objective criteria "" like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares , Dauster said . All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the "" ad hoc "" way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO . Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and non - members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings . It is a "" simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate "" policy to other producers . While consumer countries are welcome to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different "" objective criteria "" achieve different share - outs of quota , Dauster said . Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise . Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers ' offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them . "" We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage ,"" one delegate said . Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed . The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then . The board is due to meet in Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September . More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine . In that case quotas could come into force during the summer . But most delegates and traders said quotas before October are unlikely , while Brazil ' s Dauster noted the ICO has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980 . A clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now . At least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability . In contrast producers wanted stop - gap quotas to plug the seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to lapse should lasting agreement not be found . "" Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient and we wanted a cast iron commitment now ,"" one consumer said ."

47,"COFFEE TALKS FAILURE SEEN PRESSURING U . S . Failure of talks on re - establishing International Coffee Organization , ICO , coffee quotas last week may put political pressure on the United States , particularly the State Department , to reassess its position , but the U . S . is unlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by "" objective criteria "", U . S . officials said . Jon Rosenbaum , assistant U . S . trade representative and head of Washington ' s delegation to the talks , told Reuters on his return from London that the United States is willing to resume the coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary . Rosenbaum said the United States will be "" flexible "" in discussing the method of establishing objective criteria and any transition to new quotas , but not on the basic aim of establishing an objective method of setting quotas . At the ICO talks major consuming nations , led by the U . S ., proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated by a formula incorporating a producer ' s recent exportable production and verified stocks , while large producers led by Brazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of shares . The consumer position would have in effect reduced the market share of Brazil , by far the world ' s largest producer . Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support legislation now before Congress which would allow the U . S . customs service to monitor coffee imports , as a way to comply with any future coffee quotas . He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the coffee policy situation following the collapse of the London talks , but "" nobody is proposing we change our position ."" However , other U . S . government officials involved in coffee policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market offensive from producer countries , led by Brazil and Colombia , to soften the consumer position . "" Knowing that its next crop is fairly large , Brazil will kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and consumers ,"" said one U . S . official . The U . S . official , who asked not to be identified , said Brazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other countries , particularly the splinter group of small producers who differed with the major producers in London . This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin American countries , faced with mounting debt problems , to the U . S . State department , and to the National Security Council in the White House , for an easing of the U . S . position , U . S . officials said . The State department , a major player in setting U . S . coffee policy , may then face conflicting pressures , particularly from politically - sensitive U . S . allies in Central America , U . S . officials said . El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia at the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on objective criteria . But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica joined the splinter group , which said it would agree to objective criteria . There is a strong feeling among some in the State Department that the United States should continue to support the splinter group of producers who have taken the politically - risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective criteria question , U . S . officials said . Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be some pressure to reassess positions . In London , the U . S . was supported by the U . K ., the Netherlands , West Germany , Japan , Australia and New Zealand on the issue of objective criteria , U . S . officials said . This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals . However , U . S . sources said West Germany ' s support was at times qualified and there is some concern that the European Community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to producers in future talks . France backed the Ivory Coast and other African producers during the talks . A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult , although not impossible , for the U . S . to block producer plans . While political manuevering by small producers and consuming countries will be important , U . S . officials said the key to any future outcome will be Brazil ' s position . U . S . officials blamed Brazil ' s intransigence for the failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from Brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement ."
48,"COLOMBIA BLASTS U . S . FOR COFFEE TALKS FAILURE Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria blamed an inflexible U .

Position was more inflexible than the one of Brazil , where current economic and political factors make it difficult to adopt certain positions ,"" Gaviria told Reuters in an interview . The U . S . and Brazil have each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown in the negotiations to re - introduce export quotas after being extended through the weekend in London . Gaviria stressed that Colombia tried to ensure a successful outcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigent attitudes , both from producing and consuming nations , made it impossible . In a conversation later with local journalists , Gaviria said the U . S . attitude would have serious economic and political consequences , not necessarily for a country like Colombia but certainly for other Latin American nations and for some African countries . He told Reuters that Colombia , because of the relatively high level of its coffee stocks , would probably suffer less . According to Gaviria , Colombia can hope to earn about 1 , 500 mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports , which traditionally account for 55 pct of the country ' s total export revenue . That estimate would represent a drop in revenues of 1 , 400 mln dlrs from 1986 . Colombia , which held stockpiles of 10 . 5 mln bags at the start of the current coffee year , exported a record 11 . 5 mln bags in the 1985 / 86 coffee year ending last September 30 ."
49,"RIO COFFEE TRADE PREFERS NO PACT TO QUOTA CUT The failure of talks to introduce new coffee export quotas within the International Coffee Agreement , ICA , was preferable to the alternative of Brazil having a sharply reduced quota , as had been proposed , President of the Rio de Janeiro Coffee Trade Association Carlos Calmon said . He told Reuters proposals to reduce Brazil ' s quota to 25 pct of the world share from 30 pct at present were unacceptable as the country has large stocks and a good harvest is expected . "" Brazil has the capacity to export 20 mln bags this year ,"" Calmon added . Calmon said , assuming a 58 mln bag global ICA quota , Brazil ' s share under the proposals would have been 14 . 5 mln bags , of which soluble would have accounted for 2 . 0 mln , leaving just 12 . 5 mln bags of green coffee for export . "" It ' s a pity the talks broke down , but for Brazil this was better than such a quota reduction ,"" he added . In 1985 Brazil exported 19 . 6 mln bags of soluble and green coffee , including about two mln bags to non - members . A severe drought and marketing problems cut exports last year to under 10 mln bags . Calmon estimated stocks as of January 1 at 18 mln bags , of which 5 . 0 mln have already been sold for export . The harvest this year should be around 30 mln bags , he added . The latest Brazilian Coffee Institute estimate for last year ' s harvest is 11 . 2 mln bags , although many traders believe it was higher than this ."

He said the current decline on world coffee markets was not totally unexpected and would have no immediate bearing on colombia ' s financial state , which he described as sound . Gaviria said the decline in coffee prices could mean a loss of 1 . 5 billion dlrs in revenues for 1987 .

51,"IVORY COAST SAYS COFFEE PRICE FALL SHORT - LIVED Ivory Coast today predicted that the present coffee price crash recorded after the collapse of the recent International Coffee Organisation ( ICO ) meeting in London would not last long . Commenting on Monday ' s failure by producer and consumer nations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten an oversupplied coffee market , Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually be obliged to restore their positions . "" I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April ,"" he told a news conference here at his return from the failed London talks . Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day in London down about 50 sterling at 1 , 265 sterling a tonne , the lowest since 1982 . Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs ( 1 . 76 billion dlrs ) the overall loss in revenues earned by Ivory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if the slide on the world markets continues . He disclosed that his country - the world ' s biggest cocoa producer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead an African initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end of next month . Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan - based Inter - African Coffee Organisation ( IACO ) to speak on behalf of the continent ' s 25 producer nations at the London talks . "" An initiative from IACO is likely very soon ,"" he said without elaborating . "" Following the London collapse , we have immediately embarked on a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragile market ,"" he said . Questioned by journalists , the minister said President Felix Houphouet - Boigny estimated for the moment that his government would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteed by the state to Ivorian coffee - growers for the current season . Last year , the West African nation announced that the coffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs ( 65 cents ) per kilo . Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversify its agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent from world market fluctuation . A communique read over the state - run television tonight said that during today ' s weekly cabinet meeting , the veteran Ivorian leader reaffirmed "" his faith in Ivory Coast ' s bright ( economic ) future "" despite the commodities price slide . The Agriculture Minister also announced the government decided to earmark a sum of 7 . 5 billion CFA francs ( 24 . 71 mln dlrs ) to support the country ' s small farmers . Financially - strapped Ivory Coast , long regarded as one of Africa ' s showpiece economies , is going through difficult times following the sharp slump in the world price of cocoa and coffee .

54,"BRAZIL HAS NO SET COFFEE EXPORT TARGETS - IBC Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following this week ' s breakdown of International Coffee Organization talks on export quotas , President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute , IBC , Jorio Dauster said . He told a press conference Brazil now had to reconsider its export plans and that the 15 . 5 mln bag export figure which it had proposed for itself earlier should no longer be taken as the country ' s export target to ICO - member countries . The 15 . 5 mln bag offer had been made on the assumption an agreement would bring stability to world markets , he added . It had been a gesture to ease negotiations , but the lack of an agreement leaves it no longer valid and exports could be above or below 15 . 5 mln bags , he said . Dauster said he would talk to producers , exporters and market analysts before taking any decision on export policy , but any future policy would be flexible and adjusted to market conditions . "" We will not take any short - term decisions which might cause markets to panic ,"" Dauster added . He said it would be a policy which shows Brazil has coffee to sell and that it could do so without an ICO agreement . "" Brazil has coffee ( to sell ) and wants to show that it does not need an ICO agreement as a crutch ,"" Dauster said . Commenting on the breakdown of the talks , Dauster said consumer proposals would have implied a reduction of one to two mln bags in Brazil ' s export quotas . "" It was a proposal which would lead to a substantial loss for Brazil and which would be difficult for the country to recover ,"" he said . The consumer proposal to base quotas on a six - year moving average of exportable production surpluses would lead to overproduction as countries boosted output to win higher quotas , he said . Dauster rejected reports which said Brazil ' s inflexibility had been the cause for the breakdown of talks , noting that its stance had the backing of 85 pct of producing countries . Close links would continue with these producers , particularly Colombia , Mexico and Francophone African countries , but Dauster said no joint marketing action was envisaged at present . He also said Brazil currently had no plans to return to a system of roaster buying contracts , although "" no hypothesis has been abandoned ."" Dauster said he had not yet decided when registrations for May shipment coffee will be opened . He declined comment on whether the IBC will adopt a policy of opening registrations for up to six months in advance , as some exporters had suggested . He noted export registrations for the first four months of the year totalled around 5 . 5 mln bags , more than half the 9 . 9 mln exported in 1986 when drought reduced the crop to between 11 . 2 mln and 12 mln bags . He said that , although he had heard forecasts of 30 mln bags for the coming crop , the IBC would not make any estimate until late April ."
55,"PRODUCER SPLIT HEATS UP COFFEE QUOTA TALKS Talks on the possibility of reintroducing global coffee export quotas have been extended into today , with sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was not included in a key negotiating forum . The special meeting of the International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) council was called to find a way to stop a prolonged slide in coffee prices . However , delegates said no solution to the question of how to implement quotas was yet in sight . World coffee export quotas -- the major device used to regulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement -- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to a drought which cut Brazil "" s output by nearly two thirds . Brazil is the world "" s largest coffee producer and exporter . Producers and consumers now are facing off over the question of how quotas should be calculated under any future quota distribution scheme , delegates said . Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight producing countries was not represented in a contact group of five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which was set up to facilitate debate . The big producers "" want to have the ball only in their court and it isn "" t fair ,"" minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante of Costa Rica said . The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas April 1 , using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota shares , with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before September 30 , delegates said . Their plan would perpetuate the status quo , allowing Brazil to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export market , Colombia 17 pct , Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia six pct , with the rest divided among smaller exporters . But consuming countries and the dissident producer group have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined by availability , using a formula incorporating exportable production and stocks statistics . Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and Colombia and Indonesia a larger share , and bring a new quota distribution scheme into effect now rather than later . Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal that would reduce its quota share , delegates said . Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on a quota package . "" Anything is possible at this phase ,"" even adjournment of the meeting until March or April , one said . If the ICO does agree on quotas , the price of coffee on the supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a result , industry sources said . Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about steady even though coffee market prices have tumbled , so an upswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either , they said ."
56,"INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW Indonesia "" s agriculture sector will grow by just 1 . 0 pct in calendar 1987 , against an estimated 2 . 4 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines , the U . S . Embassy said in a report . Production of Indonesia "" s staple food , rice , is forecast to fall to around 26 . 3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 26 . 58 mln tonnes in 1986 , according to the annual report on Indonesia "" s agricultural performance . The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 26 . 7 mln tonnes , with a forecast 27 . 3 mln tonnes output in 1987 . The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1 . 5 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1 . 69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks . "" Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane , rubber and copra show little or no gain ,"" the report says . "" The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans , palm oil and palm kernels ."" Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds , limited fertile land , insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops , the report underlines . The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as "" wereng "" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields . The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties , and to use lower - yielding , more resistant rice types . The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee , tea , rubber , plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices . Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7 . 0 pct in 1987 to 1 . 45 mln tonnes from 1 . 35 mln , with exports rising to an estimated 720 , 000 tonnes from 695 , 000 tonnes in 1986 , the report says . But while production of soybeans in 1987 / 88 ( Oct - Sept ) will rise to 1 . 075 mln tonnes from 980 , 000 in 1986 / 87 , imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant . The report says that imports of wheat , soybeans , soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last September "" s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand . The report said that Indonesia "" s overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate , the lowest rate of growth since the mid - 1960s . It compares with 1 . 9 pct growth in 1985 and 6 . 7 pct in 1984 . The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump ."
57,"COFFEE FALL NOT SEEN AFFECTING COLOMBIA ' S DEBT The sharp fall in international coffee prices will not affect Colombia ' s external credit situation , finance minister Cesar Gaviria told reuters . He said the current depression on world coffee markets was not totally unexpected and would have no immediate bearing on Colombia ' s financial state which he described as sound . "" Our foreign debt is high , but we can pay and I hope the foreign banking community will maintain its position toward us ,"" he said . Colombia , the only major latin american country not to have rescheduled its external public debt , has a total foreign debt of 13 . 6 billion dlrs . Calls for a rescheduling of the debt have come this week from the opposition conservative party and the biggest trade union following the coffee price drop . Gaviria said lower coffee prices this year could mean a loss of 1 . 5 billion dlrs in revenues for 1987 . Gaviria submitted to the world bank and the inter - american bank last week in new york a borrowing plan , for a total of 3 . 054 billion dlrs to be disbursed over the next four years , which he said was approved ."
58,"COFFEE QUOTA TALKS CONTINUE , NO ACCORD SEEN LIKELY The International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) council talks on reintroducing export quotas continued with an extended session lasting late into Sunday night , but delegates said prospects for an accord between producers and consumers were diminishing by the minute . The special meeting , called to stop the prolonged slide in coffee prices , was likely to adjourn sometime tonight without agreement , delegates said . The council is expected to agree to reconvene either within the next six weeks or in September , they said . The talks foundered on Sunday afternoon when it became apparent consumers and producers could not compromise on the formula for calculating any future quota system , delegates said . Coffee export quotas were suspended a year ago when prices soared in response to a drought which cut Brazil ' s crop by nearly two - thirds . Brazil is the world ' s largest coffee producer and exporter ."
59,"BRAZIL DEBT SEEN PARTNER TO HARD SELL TACTICS Brazil ' s recent announcement of a suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views among many international economists and commodities analysts that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987 . The developing world ' s most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans , and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets , economists said . "" That sounds like a reasonable strategy . But there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation ,"" Aldo Roldan , Vice President for International Services at Chase Econometrics , said . Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets , but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable . "" Domestic costs have increased ( due to inflation ) and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates ,"" Roldan said . The Chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like Brazil , where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs . But he added : "" They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels ."" Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee , and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the world ' s largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance . Negotiations between International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) members to re - establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence . "" Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations , which others wanted changed ,"" one senior coffee dealer said . The dealer , who declined to be named , said Brazil wanted to preserve its market share . At the end of the talks , he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer . Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales , the dealer said . "" If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar , ninety or eighty cents ,"" he said . New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2 . 29 cents lower Thursday at 104 . 68 cents a lb , while more distant deliveries fell the six - cent maximum trading limit . President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute , Jorio Dauster told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ICO talks on export quotas . Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped - up Brazilian marketing efforts . "" They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been ,"" according to Richard Loewy , analyst for Prudential - Bache Securities Inc . Loewy believes the foreign debt problem , a good crop , plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop . "" Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they can ' t afford to store the crops ,"" he said . The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large South American crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields . "" We are going to see a very rapid decline , earlier than usual , this year in our ( U . S .) exports ,"" Loewy said . Tommy Eshleman , economist for the American Soybean Association ( ASA ), said this year ' s Brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes , versus 13 . 7 mln last year . Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the U . S . crop to bad growing weather . Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a reduction in the U . S . government soybean loan rate , offered to farmers who give crops as collateral , Eshleman said . He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate , which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market . Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan . "" We ' re getting into a period when they ( Brazil ) are starting to harvest and starting to export ,"" Eshleman said . But he added it will be a while before U . S . exports fall to below 10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently . Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation . He said the debt situation was a major consideration . "" The Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage ,"" he added . Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops , Melicias said it would not make a big difference . On other commodity markets , Brazil ' s selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital . Brazil is faced with a poor 1986 / 87 sugar harvest , which could limit exports to the world market , analysts said . The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments , and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar , will give it little room to stretch exports , they said . Brazil ' s other major crop , cocoa , is in its third year of surplus . "" Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell , so I don ' t think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it ,"" one analyst said . "" If they come out as aggressive sellers , the market would collapse and they can ' t afford to do that ,"" she added ."
60,"MEXICO SUSPENDS OVERSEAS COFFEE SALES Mexico has temporarily suspended overseas coffee sales due to falling prices triggered by the failure of the International Coffee Organisation ( ICO ) meeting to agree a quota system at its latest meeting , the official Notimex news agency said .

Mexico has already sold 80 pct of its export coffee produced in the year to last September , the source said . The country exports about 3 . 3 mln 60 - kilo bags a year ."
61,"COSTA RICA OPTIMISTIC ABOUT REFORMING ICO Costa Rica ' s economy minister said he sees new hope for winning changes in the International Coffee Organisation system of export quotas . Minister Luis Diego Escalante , who serves as president of the Costa Rican Coffee Institute , said he was hopeful because of the support offered Costa Rica and other smaller producing - nations by such major consumers as the United States , Britain and the Netherlands at last week ' s ICO meeting in london . Escalante told a news conference here he "" carried the weight of the negotiations "" at the meeting by calling for larger export quotas for the smaller coffee - growing nations . Costa rica is insisting , Escalante said , on a new quota system based on a producing nation ' s real export capacity , once it has satisfied internal demand . "" There are countries such as our own whose sales possibilities are close to or above 100 pct of their current quotas ,"" Escalante said . At the same time , there are countries favoured by the current system that have been assigned quotas far above their export potential , he said . The current ICO quota system is "" unfair and autocratic ,"" Escalante said . Escalante attributed the nosedive in international coffee prices over the last week to speculation rather than real matters of supply and demand . "" Be careful ,"" he warned , "" there ' s not as much coffee in the world as they say . What there is are bags of sawdust ."""

63,"INDONESIAN TEA , COCOA EXPORTS SEEN UP , COFFEE DOWN Indonesia ' s exports of tea and cocoa will continue to rise in calendar 1987 but coffee exports are forecast to dip slightly in 1987 / 88 ( April - March ) as the government tries to improve quality , the U . S . Embassy said . The embassy ' s annual report on Indonesian agriculture forecast coffee output in 1986 / 87 would be 5 . 77 mln bags of 60 kilograms each . That is slightly less than the 5 . 8 mln bags produced in 1985 / 86 . In 1987 / 88 coffee production is forecast to rise again to 5 . 8 mln bags , but exports to dip to 4 . 8 mln from around 5 . 0 mln in 1986 / 87 . Exports in 1985 / 86 were 4 . 67 mln bags . The embassy report says coffee stocks will rise to 1 . 3 mln tonnes in 1987 / 88 from 1 . 15 mln in 1986 / 87 . It bases this on a fall in exports as a result of the "" probable "" re - introduction of quotas by the International Coffee Organisation . Cocoa production and exports are forecast to rise steadily as the government develops cocoa plantations . Production of cocoa in Indonesia increased to 32 , 378 tonnes in calendar 1985 from 10 , 284 tonnes in 1980 . It is projected by the government to rise to more than 50 , 000 tonnes by 1988 . Production in 1986 is estimated by the embassy at 35 , 000 tonnes , as against 38 , 000 tonnes in 1987 . The report forecasts cocoa exports to rise to 35 , 000 tonnes this year , from 33 , 000 tonnes in 1986 and 31 , 000 in 1985 . The Netherlands is at present the biggest importer of Indonesian cocoa beans . The report forecasts that in calendar 1987 , Indonesia ' s CTC ( crushed , torn and curled ) tea exports will increase significantly with the coming on stream of at least eight new CTC processing plants . Indonesia plans to diversify its tea products by producing more CTC tea , the main component of tea bags . Production of black and green teas is forecast in the embassy report to rise to 125 , 000 tonnes in calendar 1987 from 123 , 000 tonnes in 1986 . Exports of these teas are likely to rise to 95 , 000 tonnes in 1987 from 85 , 000 in 1986 and around 90 , 000 in 1985 . The embassy noted the ministry of trade tightened quality controls on tea in October 1986 in an effort to become more competititve in the world market ."

66,"UGANDA DISAPPOINTED BY COFFEE TALKS FAILURE Uganda , Africa ' s second largest coffee producer , was disappointed by the stalemate in recent coffee talks in London , the chairman of the state - run Coffee Marketing Board , CMB , said . "" This has not been good for coffee producers , more so in a situation where the prices dropped by 200 pounds per tonne of robusta coffee ,"" J . Makumbi said when he returned from London on Friday . Producers and consumers failed to agree on a quota formula to share the world ' s coffee production during International Coffee Organisation , ICO , talks that ended last week . Makumbi blamed the failure to set quotas , which were suspended in Feburary last year , on Indonesian demands that its quota be increased dramatically . Uganda -- which earns about 400 mln dlrs annually from coffee exports , over 95 pct of its foreign exchange earnings -- had sought to raise its ICO quota to 3 . 0 mln from 2 . 45 mln 60 - kilo bags , according to sources close to the CMB . The CMB has estimated that production will rise 20 to 25 pct in the current 1986 / 87 October - September season to over three mln bags . For several years Uganda had been unable to meet its ICO export quota as rebel activity disrupted the coffee industry . The Ugandan government depends on coffee export duties for about 60 pct of its sales tax revenue and the industry employs over half of salaried manpower . In Dar es Salaam , Tanzania ' s Agriculture and Livestock Development Minister Paul Bomani said today Third World countries would suffer from the failure of the London coffee talks .

74,"INDONESIA PRESSING FOR COMPROMISE OVER COFFEE Indonesian coffee exporters are preparing for a period of depressed prices while urging their government to lobby for a resolution of the deadlocked issue of export quotas , the chairman of the Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters ( AICE ) told Reuters . Dharyono Kertosastro said in an interview that Indonesia , the world ' s third largest producer , is trimming costs and improving its marketing while seeking a compromise on quotas . "" But as long as Brazil sticks to its hardline position , we can never bridge the gap ,"" Dharyono said . Indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries , along with Costa Rica , the Dominican Republic , Ecuador , Honduras , India , Papua New Guinea and Peru , which proposed a new quota system at last month ' s failed International Coffee Organistion ( ICO ) talks in London . Brazil , which would have had its quota reduced under the Group of Eight scheme , blocked the proposal . AICE officials are now hoping Colombia can use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise . Edward Muda , an AICE official who attended the ICO negotiations , said Latin American members of the Group of Eight were in contact with Colombia , the world ' s second largest producer , but gave no details . "" Colombia has shown interest because they will gain from a compromise . Without one , they will suffer if the present market stays like it is ,"" Muda said . He said Indonesia was in contact with consumers such as the U . S ., Japan , the Netherlands , West Germany and Canada ahead of an ICO executive board meeting scheduled for April 1 . Dharyono said the AICE will send delegations to the U . S . And Japan to brief Indonesian embassy officials there and press them to present Indonesia ' s case more firmly . He urged the Indonesian government to do more to help the country ' s coffee traders through the ICO negotiations . Muda said the Group of Eight had some common ground with the big consumers because they agreed on the need for basing quotas on what he termed "" realistic criteria ."" The breakaway group believes the old quota system , which gives Brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports , does not reflect up - to - date supply and demand trends . Brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the old system be applied . Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market prices surged because of the failure of the Brazilian crop . Although prices have long since come down to a point where export controls could be reintroduced , producers and consumers at the 75 - member ICO have not been able to agree on new guidelines . Brazil and the U . S ., The largest consumer , are both refusing to alter their positions . Dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believed Indonesia was well placed to survive low prices . Indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and the AICE is improving its marketing system , Dharyono said . Indonesia ' s coffee output in 1986 / 87 , ending September 30 , is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last year ' s level of 360 , 000 tonnes , he said . He said stocks , at 90 , 000 tonnes , were about average for the time of year ."

The company expects prices to remain at around current levels despite the likelihood of agreement on buffer stock rules at the forthcoming London cocoa talks , and believes market intervention by the buffer stock manager would stabilise prices . Sroka said world coffee prices are expected to remain weak if any international coffee talks fail to produce agreement . Sroka said stagnating consumption and slight overproduction will continue to weigh on coffee prices and he forecast a continued build - up in stocks .

77,"NO NEAR TERM BRAZIL COFFEE MOVES EXPECTED The Brazilian Coffee Institute , IBC , is unlikely to disclose its future export policy until the end of next week at the earliest , trade sources said . IBC president Jorio Dauster is meeting government ministers , producers , exporters and market analysts to assess Brazil ' s position in the light of the failure of talks in London earlier this month to set new International Coffee Organization , ICO , export quotas . "" The failure of the talks means Brazil has got to rethink its position completely ,"" one Santos exporter said . A meeting of the National Coffee Policy Council is set for Thursday , March 19 , and Dauster will almost certainly explain his plan to members then before announcing any new measures . Dauster told reporters on his return from London last week that no decisions would be made on exports before he had held talks with all sectors of the industry . Exporters said Dauster is not under any great pressure to start marketing coffee immediately . World prices have been recovering from the lows which followed the collapse of the ICO talks and Brazil has sold a reasonable 5 . 5 mln bags of 60 kilos for export in the first four months of this year . The exporters said the key factor in the eventual opening of May and June export registrations will be the amount at which the contribution quota is set . With little expectation of other sales incentive mechanisms such as discounts , bonuses and price fall guarantees being introduced , the level of the quota will be decisive in determining the competitiveness of Brazilian coffee on world markets , they said . They noted that on February 16 , the eve of a planned increase in the quota , April registrations were opened and closed after 1 . 68 mln bags were registered for export , a record amount for a single day . If May / June registrations are opened under similar conditions as before , Brazil would have no difficulty in selling at least 2 . 0 mln bags per month . "" The problem would be how to limit sales ,"" one exporter said . Brazil ' s present foreign trade and payments problems mean there are pressures from the government to boost exports to maximise foreign exchange earnings . However , the sources said they expect the IBC to adopt a marketing strategy aimed at regaining Brazil ' s dominant position as an exporter , but without causing a price war . General opinion among exporters was that Brazil would plan to export between 17 and 18 mln bags this year of which between 1 . 5 and 2 . 0 mln would be to non - members of the ICO . The 15 . 5 mln to 16 mln bags sold to members would be around the figure Brazil had offered to ship if ICO quotas were reintroduced , although Dauster has said this offer expired with the breakdown of talks . With the prospects of a crop of at least 28 mln bags this year , Brazil has the capacity to export up to 20 mln bags after meeting local consumption of around 7 . 0 mln , the sources added . However , the sources said Brazil is unlikely even to consider exporting such quantities , as this would almost inevitably lead to a fall in world prices as Brazil tried to encroach on other producers ' markets . Maximum export earnings would be achieved by orderly marketing of traditional amounts , thus re - establishing Brazil ' s market share after last year ' s unusually low exports of 9 . 9 mln bags , enabling it to rebuild stocks and maintaining cordial relations with the producer group which backed Brazil ' s stance at the ICO talks , they added ."
78,"ICO BOARD MEETING DELAYED ONE DAY The International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) executive board meeting scheduled for the end of this month has been delayed by one day and will now run from March 31 to April 2 and not March 30 to April 1 , ICO officials said .

79,"COLOMBIA ' S COFFEE MARKETING TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE Colombia intends to improve the marketing of its coffee with the accent on more flexibility on setting export registration prices , finance minister Cesar Gaviria said . Speaking to reporters after announcing a lower export registration price , or reintegro , of 1 . 10 dlr per lb ex - dock New York , Gaviria said export mechanisms would be more agile . "" In the first stage , we decided not only to lower the reintegro but also to adopt a flexible policy of reintegro that will allow private exporters to participate more actively in Colombia ' s coffee export policy ,"" he said . Traders said this means the export registration price will change more often in a truer reflection of market trends . Gaviria said the measures merely responded to new market factors since a return to a system of International Coffee Organisation ( ICO ) export quotas may not occur in the short term . ICO talks last month in London failed to break a deadlock over re - introduction of export quotas , suspended in February 1986 . Gaviria stressed that Colombia will not necessarily suffer from depressed prices because it can compensate lower prices with increased volume . "" Colombia will continue to export its traditional amount of coffee , between 9 . 6 and 10 mln bags ( of 60 kilos ), and will do so without an agreement among producers ,"" he said . He ruled out a much higher volume of exports , or up to 13 . 5 mln bags as mentioned in market circles , "" because the idea is precisely not to disrupt the market ."" Colombia exported a record 11 . 5 mln bags in the 1985 / 86 coffee year which ended last September 30 . Echoing Gaviria ' s words , Jorge Cardenas , manager of the national coffee growers ' federation , said Colombia sought to adapt its coffee marketing policy to circumstances . "" There is great expectation in the world for the policies that Brazil and Colombia will adopt . Ours is beginning to emerge and no agreement among producers is foreseeable in the immediate future ,"" he told journalists . Trade sources in Rio today said Brazil ' s future export policy was unlikely to be revealed before the end of next week . Cardenas said a new ICO meeting could only take place when problems that hindered an agreement at the recent London talks have been resolved . Asked to comment on a Reuter report from Jakarta saying Indonesia hoped Colombia could use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise on the quota issue , Cardenas said the Brazilian stand was quite clear . He said Brazil ' s current quota "" reflects the reality of the market , allows for an orderly supply and satisfies demand ,"" but added more clarity was needed to assess the criteria that determined it . Cardenas said lows registered immediately after the failure of the London talks were triggered by a widespread fear among dealers of an imminent price war and the belief that producers would go out and sell their coffee as quickly as possible , which did not happen ."
80,"UGANDA RE - ROUTES COFFEE EXPORTS THROUGH KISUMU Long delays at the railway crossing on the Kenyan border have led Uganda to re - route its coffee exports through a ferry link with the Kenyan port of Kisumu across Lake Victoria , Ugandan officials based in Kenya said . Uganda has a direct rail link with the Kenyan port of Mombasa through which it conducts 70 pct of its external trade but there is a chronic shortage of railway wagons , they said . Customs at Kisumu take less than a day compared with two to three at the Malaba rail border crossing , a Ugandan Railways official said . "" Malaba is now handling only 10 pct of the trade and all the coffee and oil goes through Kisumu ,"" he said . However , an accident recently damaged the wagon ferry which plies between Kisumu and the Ugandan port of Jinja , causing bottlenecks on the lake route too . Sources at the Coffee Marketing Board in Kampala reported delays in coffee export shipments last January due to congestion on the lake ferries . Coffee accounts for about 95 pct of Uganda ' s export earnings and last November President Yoweri Museveni ordered all coffee shipments to be carried by rail in order to avoid the higher costs of road haulage ."
81,"COLOMBIA OPENS APRIL / MAY COFFEE REGISTRATIONS Colombia opened coffee export registrations for April and May with the National Coffee Growers ' Federation setting no limit , Gilberto Arango , president of the private exporters ' association , said .

82,"NO HEAVY COFFEE EXPORT IMPLIED - COLOMBIA OFFICIAL A decision by Colombia to open coffee export registrations for an unlimited amount does not imply the country will heavily sell coffee until recently withheld , Gilberto Arango , president of the private exporters ' association , told Reuters . Colombia today opened export registrations for april and may , with the National Coffee Growers ' Federation setting no limit . Since the start of the coffee year last october , private exporters were on average allowed 350 , 000 bags of 60 kilos per month . "" Traders will initially interpret this measure as announcing heavy sales . Even today it pressured the market . But it will quickly become apparent that Colombia does not intend to go over the top ,"" Arango said in an interview . "" Colombia ' s marketing policy is to sell without haste but consistently . No targets for volume will be set . We will react to market factors adequately . Colombia has no intention to give its coffee away ,"" he added . Arango described measures adopted here yesterday , including a lower export registration price , as a major change in Colombia ' s coffee marketing policy . The export registration price , or reintegro , was lowered to 1 . 10 dlr per lb ex - dock new york , or 155 . 83 dlrs per bag of 70 kilos , from 1 . 35 dlrs ( 194 . 33 dlrs ). The government announced a more flexible policy of reintegro , in order to closely reflect market trends , which arango warmly welcomed saying private exporters will undoubtedly be more actively present in the market . A frequent gap between international market prices and the reintegro was unlikely to recur , he said ."

84,"COLOMBIA COFFEE EXPORTERS BELIEVE IN PRAGMATISM Private coffee exporters say Colombia ' s more pragmatic coffee marketing policy will ensure that the country does not suffer excessively from current depressed prices and erratic market conditions . Gilberto Arango , president of the exporters ' association , said in an interview that Colombia , the world ' s second largest producer , was in a position to withstand a prolonged absence of International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) export quotas . "" Colombia is one of the countries that will benefit most from this situation ,"" he said . Recent ICO talks in London failed to break a deadlock over re - introduction of export quotas , suspended in February 1986 , and no date has been set for a new meeting on the issue . Arango said that government measures adopted here last week , including a lower export registration price , indicated a major change but also disclosed a welcome pragmatism . "" This is the start of a new era in Colombia because world market conditions are also new ,"" he said . The government lowered local taxes for exporters and said the export registration price , or reintegro , will be changed more often in order to closely reflect market trends . Arango said an illustration of Colombia ' s new attitude was the decision on Friday to open export registrations for an unlimited amount . But he added it did not imply the country would begin heavy selling of coffee . "" Our marketing policy is to sell without haste but consistently . No targets for volume will be set . We will react to market factors adequately and Colombia has no intention of giving its coffee away ."" Colombia ' s past records should be the basis for upcoming exports , he said . "" We will certainly not export seven mln ( 60 - kilo ) bags but neither are we going to sell like mad . The trade knows full well what Colombia ' s export potential is ,"" he said . Colombia , with stockpiles standing at about 10 mln bags , exported a record 11 . 5 mln bags in the 1985 / 86 coffee year which ended last September , and 11 . 3 mln in calendar 1986 . Arango did not want to commit himself on export predictions but said that output for the 1986 / 87 coffee year would not exceed 10 . 5 mln bags , compared with 12 mln forecast by the National Coffee Growers ' Federation and 12 . 5 mln by the U . S . Department of Agriculture , a figure he said was "" ridiculous ."" He said ageing plantations and rust , in particular in the number one producing province of Antioquia , meant output was likely to fall but that nationwide estimates were rare and oscillated between 9 . 5 mln and 11 . 5 mln bags . On the failure of the recent ICO talks , Arango said Colombia understandably felt frustrated at not having managed to force a compromise . Jorge Cardenas , manager of the national federation and head of his nation ' s delegation in London , has blamed the intransigence of some big countries , without naming them . However , Arango , like Colombian Finance Minister Cesar Gaviria last week , was more explicit and said the United States would undoubtedly be under great political pressure in coming weeks to revise its policy . "" Washington will have to take into account that for many countries , and some of its allies for instance in Central America , a sharp fall in coffee export revenue would have far - reaching political and economic consequences ."" Arango ruled out a fresh Colombian initiative on export quotas saying producers had now to show a common resolve which could emerge from continuous contacts ."
85,"ETHIOPIA MINISTER SEES AFRICA DEBT PAYMENT PROBLEM Africa may have to follow Brazil in halting foreign debt payments unless industrialised nations are prepared to be more flexible in trade and economic policy , Ethiopian trade minister Tesfay Dinka said . Growing protectionism and declining commodity prices had caused a major deterioration in the export earnings of all developing countries , he said in an opening speech to a meeting of African trade ministers in Addis Ababa . Unless there was an early improvement in developing countries ' terms of trade "" the only choice is to follow the route that Brazil appears to have taken ,"" Tesfay said . The two - day meeting of delegates from 50 African states was called to work out a consensus ahead of the Group of 77 ministerial meeting in Havana next month , when the developing countries will debate their strategy in economic negotiations with the West . Tesfay accused the West of intransigence in the negotiation of recent commodity agreements . The failure of the International Coffee Organisation to agree on the reintroduction of export quotas would mean "" several African countries will not have the foreign exchange to import essential items ,"" he said . Coffee accounts for 60 pct of Ethiopian exports and the recent fall in world coffee prices has sharply reduced the country ' s foreign exchange earnings . Adebayo Adedeji , the executive secretary of the U . N . Economic Commission for Africa , told the meeting that there was an increasing net outflow of resources from Africa . He blamed this on high interest rates , debt servicing and the repatriation of profits by foreign investors . Africa paid 13 billion dlrs to service its total foreign debt last year and by 1990 annual service payments are expected to rise to between 16 and 24 billion , Adedeji said . He accused industrialised countries of failing to provide more resources to implement the U . N . Program for Africa ' s economic recovery and development , despite Africa ' s willingness to raise two thirds of the capital from domestic sources . The U . N . Program , approved last year , calls for 128 billion dlrs of economic investment in Africa over five years . Western donors were asked to contribute 46 billion dlrs , with the rest being raised from local resources , but Adedeji said the donors had not responded as hoped . In view of this poor response , he said "" it is possible that by the year 2 , 000 nearly all African countries , except a few , will be categorised as least developed countries ."" At present , 27 of Africa ' s 50 - odd states are officially listed in this category ."
86,"ICO QUOTA TALKS CONTINUE , OUTCOME HARD TO GAUGE Talks at the extended special meeting of the International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) on the reintroduction of export quotas continued , but chances of success were still almost impossible to gauge , delegates said . Producer delegates were meeting to examine a Colombian proposal to resume historical quotas from April 1 to September , with a promise to define specific new criteria by which a new quota system would be calculated in September for the new crop year , they said . Opinions among delegates over the potential for reaching a quota agreement varied widely . Some consumers said the mood of the meeting seemed slightly more optimistic . But Brazil ' s unwillingness to concede any of its traditional 30 . 55 pct of its export market share looks likely to preclude any accord , other delegates said . No fresh proposals other than the Colombian initiative had been tabled formally today , delegates said . A full council meeting was set for 1900 hours for a progress report , delegates said ."

92,"MADAGASCAR COFFEE PRODUCTION SEEN LOWER IN 1987 Madagascar ' s available coffee output is estimated at 80 , 725 tonnes this year , down from 82 , 210 in 1986 , due to a rundown of government agricultural services and the poor state of feeder roads in rural areas , Agriculture Ministry sources said . This is after accounting for the loss of some 15 , 000 to 20 , 000 tonnes due to the transport problems in the countryside , they said . The sources did not give an estimate for exports in 1987 , but they noted that shipments declined to 37 , 200 tonnes last year from 41 , 662 in 1985 . Low yields from the country ' s ageing coffee plantations and prevalence of the fungal disease Hemileia Vastatrix also contributed to the poor performance , the sources said . They pointed out that 52 pct of Madagascar ' s coffee bushes were planted before 1930 . The sources said Madagascar was still a long way from reaching the production target of 110 , 000 tonnes per year and the export target of 63 , 000 tonnes outlined in the government ' s 1986 - 1990 five - year plan . In order to reverse the decline in coffee production , the government has decided to plant 20 , 000 hectares with high - yielding arabica and canephora varieties , the sources said . The planting programme will begin this year and is aimed at producing 300 to 360 kilos per hectare of beans with a low caffeine content . The sources added that Madagascar ' s plan to export roasted coffee has failed to take off due to packaging problems . Only 650 tonnes of roasted coffee were exported last year ."

101,"CASH CRISIS HITS UGANDAN COFFEE BOARD Uganda ' s state - run Coffee Marketing Board ( CMB ) has been suffering a cash crisis for the past two months due to a bottleneck in export shipments and administrative delays in handling payments , trade sources said . The CMB needs between 10 and 15 billion shillings ( the equivalent of seven to 10 mln dlrs ) to pay farmers and processors for coffee already delivered , but its present export revenue is insufficient to cover such expenditure , they said . The board ' s cash crisis has serious implications for the economy as a whole , since coffee accounts for 95 pct of Uganda ' s total exports . The CMB ' s financial difficulties first started in January following delays in rail - freighting export consignments of coffee to the ports of Mombasa , Dar es Salaam and Tanga . These delays were caused by a shortage of railway wagons in Uganda and bottlenecks on the ferries which transport Ugandan wagons across Lake Victoria to link up with the Kenyan and Tanzanian railway systems , the sources said Marketing Minister John Sebaana - Kizito publicly acknowledged on February 19 that the CMB had run up arrears to local suppliers as a result of the shortage of transport for moving exports . Sebaana - Kizito said at the time that the payments squeeze would be resolved in two weeks . However , an accident to the rail ferry which plies between the Ugandan lake port of Jinja and Kisumu in Kenya put it out of action between February 21 and March 15 , causing fresh delays in cargo movements . Coffee exports are especially sensitive to the disruption of rail transport since president Yoweri Museveni has banned their haulage by road in a drive to save transport costs . Transport difficulties meant that by early February the CMB was holding unsold coffee stocks of around 750 , 000 bags . These stocks were equivalent to one quarter of Uganda ' s expected three mln 60 - kilo bag 1986 / 87 ( October - September ) crop , the sources said . According to the sources , the board ' s financial problems have been aggravated by long delays in processing export receipts . The coffee board was taking about eight weeks to recycle export receipts into payments to local producers , whereas export bills handled by local banks took half that time to process , they said . The sources said the CMB ' s price structure had been overtaken by Uganda ' s high inflation rate , unofficially estimated at about 200 pct , and that this was a further disincentive to producers , already owed large arrears . "" The coffee pricing structure is wrong and three months behind , the foreign exchange rate is unrealistic , and the sooner the so - called economic package is put in top gear , the better for the coffee industry and the economy as a whole ,"" one of the sources said . The government is currently negotiating a package of economic reforms with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund aimed at underpinning a renewed inflow of foreign aid to help Uganda ' s economic recovery after 15 years of political strife ."
102,"ICO COUNCIL ENDS IN FAILURE TO AGREE QUOTAS A special meeting of the International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) council failed to agree on how to set coffee export quotas , ICO delegates said . Producers and consumers could not find common ground on the issue of quota distribution in eight days of arduous , often heated talks , delegates said . Export quotas -- the major device of the International Coffee Agreement to stabilise prices -- were suspended a year ago after coffee prices soared in reaction to a drought in Brazil which cut its output by two thirds . Delegates and industry representatives predicted coffee prices could plummet more than 100 stg a tonne to new four year lows tomorrow in response to the results of the meeting ."
103,"COFFEE TRADERS EXPECT SELLOFF AFTER ICO TALKS FAIL The failure of the International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas could trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of at least 100 stg per tonne today , coffee trade sources said . Prices could easily drop to as low as 1 . 00 dlr or even 80 cents a lb this year from around 1 . 25 dlrs now , they said . A special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set the quotas . No further meeting to discuss quotas was set , delegates said . Quotas , the major device used to stabilize prices under the International Coffee Agreement , were suspended a year ago after prices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil . With no propects for quotas in sight , heavy producer selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee roasting companies will ensue , the trade sources predicted . Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket shelf this spring , coffee dealers said . The U . S . And Brazil , the largest coffee importer and exporter respectively , each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown of the talks . Jon Rosenbaum , U . S . Assistant trade representative and delegate to the talks , said in a statement after the council adjourned , "" A majority of producers , led by Brazil , were not prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective criteria . "" We want to insure that countries receive export quotas based on their ability to supply the market , instead of their political influence in the ICO ."" Brazilian Coffee Institute ( IBC ) President Jorio Dauster countered , "" Negotiations failed because consumers tried to dictate quotas , not negotiate them ."" Previously , quotas were determined by historical amounts exported , which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global market of about 58 mln 60 - kilo bags . A majority of producers wanted quotas to continue under this basic scheme . But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers proposed carving up the export market on the basis of exportable production and stocks , which would reduce Brazil ' s share to 28 . 8 pct . Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes in many countries ' export capabilities and make coffee more readily available to consumers when they need it . A last - minute attempt by Colombia , the second largest exporter , to rescue the talks with a compromise interim proposal could not bring the two sides together . Delegates speculated Brazil ' s financial problems , illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on bank debt , have increased political pressure on the country to protect its coffee export earnings . Developing coffee - producing countries that depend heavily on coffee earnings , particularly some African nations and Colombia , are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO ' s failure to agree quotas , analysts said . The expected drop in prices could result in losses of as much as three billion dlrs in a year , producer delegates forecast . The ICO executive board will meet March 31 , but the full council is not due to meet again until September , delegates said ."
104,"COLOMBIA COFFEE REVENUE SHARPLY DOWN IN JAN / FEB Colombia ' s coffee export revenue dropped 97 mln dlrs to 233 . 6 mln dlrs for the first two months of the year against 330 . 9 mln dlrs in the similar period of 1986 , central bank preliminary figures show . Experts attributed the fall to lower world market prices following the failure to re - introduce international coffee export quotas , but they said Colombia could compensate the drop with higher exports in calendar 1987 . Coffee export revenue for 1986 was 2 . 33 billion dlrs , according to the bank . Jorge Cardenas , manager of the National Coffee Growers ' Federation , last week estimated the recent drop of 30 cents a lb in coffee prices would mean a net loss revenue of 457 mln dlrs for Colombia . But he stressed that Colombia , with stockpiles of 10 mln ( 60 - kg ) bags , had the capacity to export more and would use a recently - introduced more flexible marketing policy to do so ."

108,"IBC PRESIDENT NOT TO ATTEND ICO EXECUTIVE BOARD Brazilian Coffee Institute ( IBC ) president Jorio Dauster said he will not attend the ICO executive board meeting and was surprised to hear that a report of his absence had a slightly depressing effect on the New York coffee market today . "" I have too much work to accomplish here in Brazil at the moment . Besides the presence of the IBC president at an ICO executive board meeting is not a tradition ,"" Dauster said . Dauster said except in rare cases , Brazil has always sent its London - based representative to ICO board meetings . Ambassador Lindenberg Sette will attend the meeting , he said ."
109,"DAUSTER SAYS NO CHANGE IN BRAZIL ' S COFFEE POLICY Brazil will not announce any changes to its coffee export policy , Brazilian Coffee Institute ( IBC ) president Jorio Dauster said . He told Reuters Brazil was not planning to modify the position it held before the recent International Coffee Organisation meeting . Earlier this month , talks in London to set new ICO export quotas failed . Commenting on the outcome of a coffee producers ' meeting in Managua last weekend , Dauster said that they discussed nothing involving the market . "" In the meeting we agreed to work on behalf of the union of the producers in matters related to an international agreement ,"" Dauster said . The Managua meeting was attended by representatives from Brazil , Mexico , Guatemala , El Salvador , Honduras , Costa Rica , Nicaragua and Panama , the latter represented at the meeting merely as an observer ."
110,"COFFEE PRICE FALL SHORT TERM - DUTCH ROASTERS This morning ' s sharp decline in coffee prices , following the breakdown late last night of negotiations in London to reintroduce International Coffee Organization , ICO , quotas , will be short - lived , Dutch roasters said . "" The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to the failure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas , but it will not be long before reality reasserts itself and prices rise again ,"" a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasters said . "" The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffee available at present , there is a shortage of quality ,"" he said . "" Average prices fell to around 110 cents a lb following the news of the breakdown but we expect them to move back again to around 120 cents within a few weeks ,"" the roaster added . Dutch Coffee Roasters ' Association secretary Jan de Vries said although the roasters were disappointed at the failure of consumer and producer ICO representatives to agree on quota reintroduction , it was equally important that quotas be reallocated on a more equitable basis . "" There is no absolute need for quotas at this moment because the market is well balanced and we must not lose this opportunity to renegotiate the coffee agreement ,"" he said . "" There is still a lot of work to be done on a number of clauses of the International Coffee Agreement and we would not welcome quota reintroduction until we have a complete renegotiation ,"" de Vries added . With this in mind , and with Dutch roasters claiming to have fairly good forward cover , the buying strategy for the foreseeable future would probably be to buy coffee on a hand - to - mouth basis and on a sliding scale when market prices were below 120 cents a lb , roasters said ."
0,"BAHIA COCOA REVIEW Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone , alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao , although normal humidity levels have not been restored , Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review . The dry period means the temporao will be late this year . Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155 , 221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5 . 93 mln against 5 . 81 at the same stage last year . Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures . Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end . With total Bahia crop estimates around 6 . 4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6 . 2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers , middlemen , exporters and processors . There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining + Bahia superior + certificates . In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment . Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos . Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1 , 750 to 1 , 780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named . New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June / July going at 1 , 850 and 1 , 880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july , Aug / Sept at 1 , 870 , 1 , 875 and 1 , 880 dlrs per tonne FOB . Routine sales of butter were made . March / April sold at 4 , 340 , 4 , 345 and 4 , 350 dlrs . April / May butter went at 2 . 27 times New York May , June / July at 4 , 400 and 4 , 415 dlrs , Aug / Sept at 4 , 351 to 4 , 450 dlrs and at 2 . 27 and 2 . 28 times New York Sept and Oct / Dec at 4 , 480 dlrs and 2 . 27 times New York Dec , Comissaria Smith said . Destinations were the U . S ., Covertible currency areas , Uruguay and open ports . Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March / April , 785 dlrs for May , 753 dlrs for Aug and 0 . 39 times New York Dec for Oct / Dec . Buyers were the U . S ., Argentina , Uruguay and convertible currency areas .

Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6 . 13 mln bags against the 1986 / 87 crop and 1 . 06 mln bags against the 1987 / 88 crop . Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after carnival which ends midday on February 27 ."

2,"COCOA CHAIRMAN WORKS TOWARDS BUFFER COMPROMISE International Cocoa Organization ' s , ICCO , council chairman Denis Bra Kanon continued work towards a compromise plan on how the ICCO buffer stock should buy cocoa , consumer delegates said . Consumer delegates said Bra Kanon had not formally presented the compromise plan to producers and consumers , and it was unlikely he would do so before Friday , they said . There was widespread confidence a result on the outstanding items could be reached by Friday , when the council session is due to end , consumers said . Bra Kanon completed bilateral consultations with several delegations today on the main sticking points in the draft buffer stock rules package , they said . Certain delegations wanted further discussion on the amount of non - member cocoa the buffer stock will be permitted to buy , differentials for different origin cocoas and limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby , and forward material , the delegates said . The buffer stock working group finalized the remaining buffer stock rules , with only minor modifications to the original draft buffer stock package produced last week , the delegates said . The ICCO council is due to elect a new executive director when it reconvenes Friday , producer delegates said . Producers intend to present a single candidate for the post , and this is most likely to be Edouard Kouame from Ivory Coast , they said . Earlier , the existing executive director , Kobena Erbynn from Ghana , was expected to re - nominated , but he is now likely to withdraw , the delegates said . The executive committee is due to meet Friday at 1100 GMT , with the council unlikely to reconvene until late Friday , consumers said ."
3,"COCOA BUFFER STOCK COMPROMISE GAINING ACCEPTANCE A final compromise proposal on cocoa buffer stock rules presented by International Cocoa Organization , ICCO , council chairman Denis Bra Kanon is swiftly gaining acceptance by consumer and producer members , delegates said . "" We are close , nearer than ever to accepting it , but we still have some work to do ,"" producer spokesman Mama Mohammed of Ghana told Reuters after a producers ' meeting . European Community , EC , delegates said EC consumers accepted the package in a morning meeting and predicted "" no problems "" in getting full consumer acceptance . Delegates on both sides are keen to come to some agreement today , the last day of the fortnight - long council meeting , they said . The compromise requires that buffer stock purchases from non - ICCO member countries cannot exceed 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases , delegates said . The non - member cocoa issue has been among the most contentious in the rules negotiations . The 15 pct figure , up five percentage points from earlier proposals , represents a concession to consumers , delegates said . They have demanded a larger allowance for non - member cocoa in the buffer stock than producers have wanted . Another problem area , delegates said , was the question of price differentials for different origins of cocoa bought into the buffer stock , by which the buffer stock manager could fairly compare relative prices of different cocoas offered to him . The compromise narrowed the range of differentials between the origins from what previous proposals had detailed -- a move some delegates described as "" just fiddling ."" But the adjustments may prove significant enough to appease some countries that were not satisfied with the original proposed differentials assigned to them , delegates said . The compromise also stated buffer stock purchases on any day would be limited to 40 pct each in nearby , intermediate or forward positions , delegates said . If the compromise is accepted by the council , most consumers and producers want buffer stock rules to take effect next week , or as soon as practically possible . The full council is scheduled to meet around 1500 GMT to discuss the compromise , and could agree on it then if all parties are satisfied , they said . Consumers are due to meet before the council ."

7,"ICCO COUNCIL AGREES COCOA BUFFER STOCK RULES The International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) Council reached agreement on rules to govern its buffer stock , the device it uses to keep cocoa off the market to stabilise prices , ICCO delegates said . The date on which the new rules will take effect has not been decided but delegates said they expected them to come into force early next week , after which the buffer stock manager can begin buying or selling cocoa . Since prices are below the "" may - buy "" level of 1 , 655 Special Drawing Rights a tonne set in the cocoa pact , the manager is likely to buy cocoa sooon to support the market , they said . Delegates and traders said they expected the manager , Juergen Plambeck , to intervene in the market within three weeks of the pact coming into force . The rules permit him to buy and sell cocoa from origins or the second hand market on an offer system , not by means of a posted price as in the previous cocoa accord . The cocoa will be priced according to a fixed set of differentials , ranging from 137 stg for most expensive Ghana cocoa to zero for Malaysian cocoa . Purchases from non - members , such as Malaysia , will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock and those on any one day should be limited to 40 pct each in nearby , intermediate and forward positions . The council meeting , which is expected to conclude two weeks of sessions involving various working groups and the council itself , was continuing , the delegates said . The current cocoa agreement came into force on January 20 during a previous meeting of the council which was unable to agree on the rules to implement buffer stock operations ."
8,"COCOA BUFFER STOCK RULES EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY The cocoa buffer stock rules just decided by the International Cocoa Organization , ICCO , council will take effect immediately , delegates said . That means the buffer stock manager is likely to begin buying cocoa within two or three weeks , after organizing communication systems and assessing the market , they said ."
9,"COCOA BUFFER DIFFERENTIALS DETAILED The International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) council agreed standard price differentials for different origin cocoas to form part of the buffer stock buying and selling procedure , consumer delegates said . The buffer stock manager will accept offers for different origin cocoas according to a sliding scale of price differentials , under which Ghana cocoa will be pegged at a 137 stg premium to Malaysian . Thus , if the buffer stock manager was buying cocoa based on a Malaysian price of 1 , 200 stg a tonne , he would accept Ghana offers up to 1 , 337 stg . Differentials were fixed as follows , Country Differential stg / tonne Malaysia 0 Brazil 55 Ivory Coast 67 Cameroun 77 Nigeria 120 Togo 130 Ghana 137 Nigeria ' s differential is on "" landed weight "" terms . Shipping weight terms will be accepted at a 15 stg discount to this rate ."
10,"COCOA COUNCIL MEETING ENDS AFTER AGREEING RULES The International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) council adjourned after agreeing buffer stock rules for the 1986 International Cocoa Agreement , an ICCO spokesman said . The buffer stock will begin operations immediately , he said . He confirmed delegate reports that the buffer stock manager will trade cocoa by means of an offer system , and according to fixed differentials for cocoa from different origins . Purchases from non - members will be limited to 15 pct of the total and buying or selling operations in any one day will be restricted to a maximum of 40 pct each for nearby , intermediate and forward positions , he said ."

13,"EC COMMISSIONER WELCOMES COCOA ACCORD The new International Cocoa Agreement should lead to a stabilisation of prices , both benefitting producer countries and promoting an equilibrium in international economic relations , European Community Development Commissioner Lorenzo Natali said . He said in a statement welcoming the agreement on buffer stock rules reached last week in London that it resulted in large part from initiatives taken by the EC Commission after consumers and producers had reached deadlock in initial negotiations ."
14,"COCOA DEAL SEEN POSITIVE , BUT NO PRICE GUARANTEE The buffer stock rules agreement reached on Friday by the International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) is an improvement on previous arrangements but the price - support mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa prices , many ICCO delegates and trade sources said . The accord was reached between producers and consumers of the 35 - member ICCO council after two weeks of talks . European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the accord may boost cocoa prices immediately , but world surpluses overhanging the market will pull prices down again before long . "" If the buffer stock operation is successful , I doubt it will do anything more than stop the price from falling further , and it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolate prices ,"" a European dealer said . And if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying , or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market is relying on him to do so , the bearish trade reaction could pressure prices dramatically , dealers said . The buffer stock is the market - regulating tool of the ICCO , into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to manoeuvre prices into a pre - set stabilization range . A new cocoa agreement came into force in January but delegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time . The new rules take effect immediately . The buffer stock manager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three weeks , after organizing communications with cocoa producing countries and assessing the market , since prices are below the "" must - buy "" level of 1 , 600 Special Drawing Rights per tonne specified in the agreement , the sources said . The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum 100 , 000 tonnes within a five week period , but its approach will be more cautious , buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said . The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a buying limit of 250 , 000 tonnes of cocoa , 100 , 000 tonnes of which are already in the buffer stock . ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance of stabilizing prices . Ivory Coast is the world ' s largest cocoa producer . "" We have established rules which will permit us to withdraw immediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market ,"" Bra Kanon told reporters after the council adjourned . Bra Kanon reckoned the world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94 , 000 tonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee . However , some producer and consumer members emerged from the final ICCO council meeting with reservations about the pact . Ghana , whose high - quality cocoa is the world ' s most expensive and provides 60 pct of the country ' s export earnings , made a formal protest to the council about the price differentials assigned to its cocoa , saying they were too high for Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock . According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of West Germany , "" Consumers weren ' t perfectly happy with the buffer stock rules . We reached a very sensitive compromise ... There were no real winners or losers ."" Some European Community delegates were not satisfied that important points were fully discussed during the talks , and as a result , doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as effectively as they could have , delegates said . Under the new rules , the buffer stock manager would seek offers of different origin cocoas , using price differentials to reflect different qualities . Non - ICCO member cocoa can comprise up to 15 pct of the total buffer stock . London cocoa prices traded today around 1 , 300 stg per tonne , down from around 1 , 450 stg in January 1987 and 1 , 750 stg in January 1986 . A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120 , 000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session decides market conditions warrant it , according to the agreement . The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall below the 1 , 600 SDR lower intervention price for more than five days and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has been filled , or if the buffer stock runs low on funds , it says . The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at an executive committee meeting on June 9 / 12 , ICCO officials said ."
15,"COMMODITY PACTS MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS MARKET Consuming countries , chastened by the collapse of International Tin Council ( ITC ) price support operations in 1985 , are insisting more than ever before that commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are serving , a Reuter survey showed . They want price ranges to be more responsive to market trends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining the accords ' support operations - and intervention rules that avoid the risk of exports by non - members undermining the pacts . Consumers and producers , mindful of ITC buffer stock losses , have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations . Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and prefer to assess each commodity case by case , the survey showed . The International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) last week set precise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager ( BSM ) could do under the new agreement . It imposed daily and weekly purchase limits , prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets and stipulated , after consumer insistence , that up to 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases could be of non - member cocoa . This will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia , the world ' s fourth largest producer , undermining the market . The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades . A new International Natural Rubber Agreement ( INRA ) was adopted earlier this month in Geneva . Importing and exporting countries agreed several changes to make the reference price more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance operations . Direct cash contributions from members will fund buffer stock purchases . Bank financing was a particular feature of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling . Legal wrangles continue . Recent International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) negotiations in London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that agreements reflect market reality , commodity analysts said . Consumers and a small group of producers argued that "" objective criteria "" should be used to define export quota shares , which would have meant a reduction in the share of Brazil , the world ' s leading producer . Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of 30 pct . The talks broke down and , although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today , delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term negotiations on export quota distribution as remote . International agreements exist for sugar and wheat . These do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for discussions on possible future economic agreements , collect statistics and draw up market analyses . Analysts said differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any progress towards an accord with economic teeth , while sheer competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat . An alternative focus for commodity discussions are international study groups , made up of governments with advice from industry , such as those for lead and zinc and rubber . The U . N . Common fund for commodities , with a planned directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs , has failed to become operational because neither the U . S . Nor the Soviet Union has ratified it . U . S . Officials in Washington said the U . S . Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives , citing the lack of widespread support . U . S . Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in Kuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity pact case by case . U . S . Officials said it has been willing to study individual cases for economically sound , market - oriented commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests . "" We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the price of a commodity whose long - term trend is downward ,"" official Administration policy states . The U . S . Currently belongs to only two international commodity agreements that have economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement ( ICA ) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat pacts . The U . S . Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries , the State Department said . U . S . Officials singled out the INRA as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working . U . S . Negotiators were successful in getting other members of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect market trends and also to continue the accord as a market oriented agreement , U . S . Officials said . Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on the merits of each case . Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country , the world ' s top producer of rubber , tin and palm oil , decides its participation in international commodity pacts case by case . Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing Countries ( ATPC ) which produce 65 pct of world tin . The ATPC launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96 , 000 tonnes for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50 , 000 from 70 , 000 . Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and delegate to cocoa , wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told Reuters in London , "" Agreements with economic clauses to stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were close to market reality , if there was full participation by producers and consumers , and if participants were prepared to take their obligations in the framework of the agreement seriously ."" But Baron added , "" No real sanctions are available for a country that doesn ' t stick to its obligations ... The German approach is sceptical . We don ' t think agreements are the best instrument to help developing countries . They were never meant to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how developing countries often interpret them ."" Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of commodity agreements , reflecting its strong links with Third World producing countries . But recently demands for more stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the need for "" intellectual honesty "" and "" objective criteria "" have grown . British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid . It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree of transparency and do not contain the risk of open - ended borrowing that occurred in the tin pact , they said . U . K . Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather than dictate what prices should be . A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price realism in commodity pacts , adding high prices inflate supply . A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable to commodity pacts . France , a large consumer and producer of sugar , favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real market situation , particularly regarding stocks . Indonesia ' s Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told Reuters in Jakarta : "" These agreements can work as long as the problems are cyclical .. But it ' s another matter when there are structural problems .. But we are still committed to commodity agreements as an act of faith ."" Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity agreements . "" The political will is not there on the part of some consumers to make agreements work ,"" Martinez Cuenca said . The head of the economics department in the Brazilian Foreign Ministry , Sebastiao do Rego Barros , told Reuters an agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market reality . If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system of quotas , with a link between prices practised inside the pact and actual market prices , it can work . UNCTAD spokesman Graham Shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings enhance developing countries ' ability to service debt and mean greater demand for industrialised nations ' capital goods ."
16,"CSCE RESTRUCTURES COFFEE FUTURES DAILY LIMITS The Coffee , Sugar and Cocoa Exchange has expanded the normal daily trading limit in Coffee "" C "" contracts to 6 . 0 cents a lb , from the previous 4 . 0 cents , effective today , the CSCE said .

In addition , the 6 . 0 cent limit can be increased to 9 . 0 cents a lb if the first two limited months both make limit moves in the same direction for two consecutive sessions , according to the CSCE announcement . Before the rule change today , the CSCE required two days of limit moves in the first three restricted contracts before expanding the daily trading limit . Under new guidelines , if the first two restricted deliveries move the 6 . 0 cent limit for two days the Exchange will expand the limit . The expanded 9 . 0 cent limit will remain in effect until the settling prices on both of the first two limited months has not moved by more than the normal 6 . 0 cent limit for other contracts in two successive trading sessions , the CSCE said ."
17,"TRADERS CUT BAHIA TEMPORAO COCOA CROP ESTIMATE Trade estimates of the coming May / September temporao harvest in Brazil ' s main cocoa growing state of Bahia are now in the 1 . 5 mln to 2 . 0 mln 60 - kilo bag range against 2 . 0 mln to 2 . 5 mln two weeks ago . Traders in the state capital Salvador told Reuters the effects of a dry period in the first six weeks of the year had been harsher than thought earlier . Although good flowering had followed the onset of rains in mid - February subsequent pod setting was dissappointing . Last year ' s temporao , also hit by a dry spell , was 2 . 77 mln bags . In 1984 severe drought cut the crop to 1 . 79 mln bags . The traders said another factor leading to lower crop predictions is that many farmers are not caring properly for plantations because of low returns on their investment . Manpower , fertiliser and other costs have been cut back as farmers feel the pinch of the rise in interest rates over the past six months coupled with low bean prices . If such economies continue into the winter months both the temporao and the developing October / April main crop could face serious damage from pod rot attacks on trees which would normally be treated against the disease . Recent very wet weather has already caused some isolated incidences of pod rot but reports from the growing regions say these are not yet significant . The traders said they expect very low deliveries of temporao beans in the first three months of the harvest and the bulk will not appear until the last month , September . Despite the low loads , trees are said to be in excellent condition and recent flowering and pod setting - which will lead to late temporao / early main crop beans - has been good ."
18,"CSCE ALTERS RULES ON TRADING LIMITS The Coffee , Sugar and Cocoa Exchange amended regulations governing expanded trading limits on coffee , cocoa and sugar contracts to provide uniformity . Effective today , the exchange will permit normal daily price limits in those commodities to expand whenever the first two limited contract months move the limit in the same direction for two consecutive sessions . The normal daily limits will be reinstated once the first two limited deliveries close by less than the normal limit for two successive trading days . Previously exchange rules required the first three limited months to move the limit in coffee and cocoa . It had required the first two limited sugar deliveries to make such moves for three consecutive sessions ."
19,"GHANA COCOA PURCHASES SLOW The Ghana Cocoa Board said it purchased 214 tonnes of cocoa in the 24th week , ended March 19 , of the 1986 / 87 main crop season , compared with 456 tonnes the previous week and 372 tonnes in the 24th week ended March 27 of the 1985 / 86 season .

20,"MALAYSIA DECLINES TO STATE POSITION ON COCOA PACT Government officials in Malaysia , a major cocoa producer , have declined to say whether it will join the International Cocoa Agreement ( ICCA ) for which buffer stock rules were agreed in London last week . Ministry of Primary Industries officials said in January the cabinet would decide on Malaysia ' s participation , but so far a decision has not been announced . The government is said to be in favour of joining the pact , but local cocoa growers and traders told Reuters they are against the idea because certain provisions in it may be to their disadvantage . Malaysia is the world ' s fourth largest cocoa producer . The government feels that the pact , through its buffer stock mechanism , can help stabilise prices in a market which is labouring under surpluses , officials said . But growers and traders are concerned Malaysia ' s participation in the pact will require them to pay a levy for exports of cocoa to non - member countries of the ICCA . They estimate the levy at around 100 ringgit a tonne at current prices and said they are not prepared to accept it because a big portion of Malaysia ' s cocoa exports , officially estimated at 112 , 000 tonnes in 1986 , goes to non - members . Most growers and traders added they are also against a buffer stock measure under the agreement which requires withholding of cocoa stocks when prices slump . Malaysia , which produced 117 , 000 tonnes of cocoa last year , might be forced to withhold up to 70 , 000 tonnes worth some 30 mln ringgit under such a measure in the long - term , and this might affect their economic viability , they said . "" The cost of maintaining such a stock can be high and it will be a real messy business for the government and the trade if it ever occurs ,"" an industry source said . The growers and traders also said that under new buffer stock rules Malaysia can continue to benefit even if it is not a member of the pact , as the buffer stock manager is also allowed to buy from non - members for the stockpile . Under the new rules purchases from non - members , such as Malaysia , will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock . Malaysia has come under pressure from some producers to join the pact soon , officials said , but they noted that it need not rush to do so as there are provisions which allow countries to join the agreement even at a later date ."
21,"JAPAN DENIES PLANS TO CUT DUTIES ON CHOCOLATE Agriculture Ministry officials said they are not considering cuts in import duties on chocolate to help ease friction with the United States over agricultural trade . Japan has already lowered the duties sharply and we must consider domestic market conditions , an official said . Duties on chocolate were cut to 20 pct from 31 . 9 pct in April 1983 . Washington has been demanding a cut to seven pct , equivalent to its own duties , ministry sources said . Japanese chocolate imports rose to 8 , 285 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 5 , 908 in 1985 , official statistics show . However , the ministry sources added it is possible the government may make further cuts in response to strong U . S . And European demand . "" Due to concern about the farm trade row with the U . S ., Top - level government officials may press the ministry to cut the duties ,"" one said . But he said it would be difficult for Japan to resolve its overall trade row with Washington and reduce its trade surplus , which reached 58 . 6 billion dlrs in 1986 . Agricultural trade issues between Japan and the U . S . Include Japanese import restrictions on 12 farm products ."
22,"LONDON COCOA TRADES AT LOWS BY MIDMORNING Cocoa futures fell to session lows by midmorning , posting losses from last night of six to two stg a tonne in 1987 deliveries , dealers said . Weekend profittaking by jobbers and general book - squaring featured the fall which was aided by steady sterling versus the dollar and lack of offtake in the physicals market . Dealers said the market was switch and straddle - bound , in that any pressure on one particular month was certain to be reflected in adjacent deliveries . The undertone , however , remained cautious as operators await an eventual start to ICCO buffer stock buying , dealers said . The market was originally forecast to open with average five stg gains from last night following New York ' s firmer close yesterday , dealers said . But this was largely counter - balanced by currency factors . Near July traded at its session low of 1 , 327 stg after one hour versus 1 , 333 bid last night and an early high of 1 , 335 . Volume midmorning was 730 lots including 350 lots crossed and 108 switches . There was no sign of any origin activity ."

24,"LEADING COCOA PRODUCERS DISCUSS INTERNATIONAL PACT Leading cocoa producers will discuss whether newly - agreed rules on an international cocoa buffer stock will succeed in reversing a sharp fall in world prices when they start four day ' s of talks here later today , conference sources said . Another topic likely to be discussed at the twice - yearly meeting of the Cocoa Producer Alliance ( CPA ) is the pact ' s second line of market support -- a witholding scheme under which exporters can take up to 120 , 000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if buffer stock purchases fail to defend prices . The International Cocoa Organisation is due to discuss the scheme at a meeting in June , and exporters could use the Yaounde talks to work out a common position on the issue , the sources said . Delegates will also be briefed on arrangements for an international cocoa research conference due to take place in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic next month , CPA secretary general D . S . Kamga said . The 11 - member CPA include the world ' s top three producers of Ivory Coast , Brazil and Ghana and accounts for around 80 pct of world output ."
25,"COCOA BUFFER STOCK MAY FACE UPHILL BATTLE - TRADE The International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the downtrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying operations in the next few weeks , cocoa traders said . Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could reach 75 , 000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices significantly , given the amount of surplus cocoa overhanging the market . The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the ICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 1 , 578 . 03 Special Drawing Rights ( SDR ) per tonne , below the 1 , 600 "" must buy "" level . Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last month by the ICCO council . Buying will begin once the buffer stock manager has completed preparations , traders said . Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer stock buying until mid or end - April when changes in months used to calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average above the 1 , 600 SDR "" must buy "" level . The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of the second , third and fourth positions on the London and New York futures markets . The daily price was 1 , 577 . 61 SDR per tonne yesterday . Months used currently for the indicator are May , July and September , but these are set to change to July , September and December on April 15 , prior to May becoming the New York spot month , traders noted . The introduction of December into the calculations may lift the daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75 stg above May on the London terminal market . But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the higher daily price to feed through into the 10 - day average , the indicator which governs his activities , traders said . "" The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the implications of delaying until forward prices lift the indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa ,"" an analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said . Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75 , 000 tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts . If purchases reach this level within six months , buying is suspended pending an ICCO council review of price ranges . But some cocoa market watchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent forecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 1 . 5 mln to two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to three mln . A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 1986 / 87 world surplus to between 50 , 000 and 70 , 000 tonnes , compared with a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of 94 , 000 tonnes , traders said . In these circumstances , the buffer stock may only need to buy between 20 , 000 and 30 , 000 tonnes to lift prices above the "" must buy "" level . But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock manager can remove cocoa from the market . The buffer stock system of price differentials set according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from non - members could limit the buffer stock ' s scope for action , dealers said . Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is nearby in - store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin . But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as Malaysia is not an ICCO member , while purchases of nearby cocoa can only reach 40 pct in any one day , which forces the buffer stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material . Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non - member cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are pressured by the overhang of Malaysian material , traders said . Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from quality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact on futures , but is likely to widen physical market premiums for this cocoa over futures . Ghana ' s premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer stock buying , dealers said . "" The buffer stock may not help the terminal market , but will provide a backstop for quality cocoas ,"" one trader said . Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer stock were "" all prognostication "" and that no one could hope to predict accurately what the result would be . Psychologically buffer stock buying should help prices , but since the buffer stock already holds a carryover of 100 , 000 tonnes from the previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus , dealers expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure . In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholding scheme as an additional market support mechanism ."
26,"BRAZIL DEBT SEEN PARTNER TO HARD SELL TACTICS Brazil ' s recent announcement of a suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views among many international economists and commodities analysts that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987 . The developing world ' s most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans , and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets , economists said . "" That sounds like a reasonable strategy . But there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation ,"" Aldo Roldan , Vice President for International Services at Chase Econometrics , said . Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets , but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable . "" Domestic costs have increased ( due to inflation ) and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates ,"" Roldan said . The Chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like Brazil , where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs . But he added : "" They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels ."" Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee , and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the world ' s largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance . Negotiations between International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) members to re - establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence . "" Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations , which others wanted changed ,"" one senior coffee dealer said . The dealer , who declined to be named , said Brazil wanted to preserve its market share . At the end of the talks , he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer . Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales , the dealer said . "" If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar , ninety or eighty cents ,"" he said . New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2 . 29 cents lower Thursday at 104 . 68 cents a lb , while more distant deliveries fell the six - cent maximum trading limit . President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute , Jorio Dauster told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ICO talks on export quotas . Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped - up Brazilian marketing efforts . "" They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been ,"" according to Richard Loewy , analyst for Prudential - Bache Securities Inc . Loewy believes the foreign debt problem , a good crop , plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop . "" Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they can ' t afford to store the crops ,"" he said . The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large South American crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields . "" We are going to see a very rapid decline , earlier than usual , this year in our ( U . S .) exports ,"" Loewy said . Tommy Eshleman , economist for the American Soybean Association ( ASA ), said this year ' s Brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes , versus 13 . 7 mln last year . Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the U . S . crop to bad growing weather . Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a reduction in the U . S . government soybean loan rate , offered to farmers who give crops as collateral , Eshleman said . He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate , which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market . Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan . "" We ' re getting into a period when they ( Brazil ) are starting to harvest and starting to export ,"" Eshleman said . But he added it will be a while before U . S . exports fall to below 10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently . Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation . He said the debt situation was a major consideration . "" The Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage ,"" he added . Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops , Melicias said it would not make a big difference . On other commodity markets , Brazil ' s selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital . Brazil is faced with a poor 1986 / 87 sugar harvest , which could limit exports to the world market , analysts said . The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments , and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar , will give it little room to stretch exports , they said . Brazil ' s other major crop , cocoa , is in its third year of surplus . "" Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell , so I don ' t think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it ,"" one analyst said . "" If they come out as aggressive sellers , the market would collapse and they can ' t afford to do that ,"" she added ."
27,"INDONESIAN TEA , COCOA EXPORTS SEEN UP , COFFEE DOWN Indonesia ' s exports of tea and cocoa will continue to rise in calendar 1987 but coffee exports are forecast to dip slightly in 1987 / 88 ( April - March ) as the government tries to improve quality , the U . S . Embassy said . The embassy ' s annual report on Indonesian agriculture forecast coffee output in 1986 / 87 would be 5 . 77 mln bags of 60 kilograms each . That is slightly less than the 5 . 8 mln bags produced in 1985 / 86 . In 1987 / 88 coffee production is forecast to rise again to 5 . 8 mln bags , but exports to dip to 4 . 8 mln from around 5 . 0 mln in 1986 / 87 . Exports in 1985 / 86 were 4 . 67 mln bags . The embassy report says coffee stocks will rise to 1 . 3 mln tonnes in 1987 / 88 from 1 . 15 mln in 1986 / 87 . It bases this on a fall in exports as a result of the "" probable "" re - introduction of quotas by the International Coffee Organisation . Cocoa production and exports are forecast to rise steadily as the government develops cocoa plantations . Production of cocoa in Indonesia increased to 32 , 378 tonnes in calendar 1985 from 10 , 284 tonnes in 1980 . It is projected by the government to rise to more than 50 , 000 tonnes by 1988 . Production in 1986 is estimated by the embassy at 35 , 000 tonnes , as against 38 , 000 tonnes in 1987 . The report forecasts cocoa exports to rise to 35 , 000 tonnes this year , from 33 , 000 tonnes in 1986 and 31 , 000 in 1985 . The Netherlands is at present the biggest importer of Indonesian cocoa beans . The report forecasts that in calendar 1987 , Indonesia ' s CTC ( crushed , torn and curled ) tea exports will increase significantly with the coming on stream of at least eight new CTC processing plants . Indonesia plans to diversify its tea products by producing more CTC tea , the main component of tea bags . Production of black and green teas is forecast in the embassy report to rise to 125 , 000 tonnes in calendar 1987 from 123 , 000 tonnes in 1986 . Exports of these teas are likely to rise to 95 , 000 tonnes in 1987 from 85 , 000 in 1986 and around 90 , 000 in 1985 . The embassy noted the ministry of trade tightened quality controls on tea in October 1986 in an effort to become more competititve in the world market ."

The company expects prices to remain at around current levels despite the likelihood of agreement on buffer stock rules at the forthcoming London cocoa talks , and believes market intervention by the buffer stock manager would stabilise prices . Sroka said world coffee prices are expected to remain weak if any international coffee talks fail to produce agreement . Sroka said stagnating consumption and slight overproduction will continue to weigh on coffee prices and he forecast a continued build - up in stocks . The recent failure of the London coffee talks had surprised market observers . Unless reason prevails and the major producers return to the conference table , the world coffee market will remain free and the consequences for some producers dependant on coffee for their foreign exchange earnings would be catastrophic , Sroka added ."
32,"PESSIMISM MOUNTS OVER BAHIAN TEMPORAO COCOA CROP Pessimism over the effects of a prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is rising with trade forecasts generally in the 2 . 0 mln to 2 . 5 mln bag range against 2 . 5 mln to 3 . 0 mln a fortnight ago . Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital of Salvador that despite scattered rains since mid - February , which broke a six week drought , plantations have not picked up as hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the first three months of the May / September crop . The sources said arrivals from May through July might only reach around 600 , 000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of 1 . 0 mln to 1 . 5 mln bags might be expected . Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods from current flowering are gathered . However , the sources noted a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot , which flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid , and which is more likely from late July on . This year ' s crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot . A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over 500 , 000 bags in a very short period , one source said . Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage , estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2 . 0 mln bag mark if the disease hits . Although flowering was good following the start of the rains , pod setting was not up to expectations , possibly because the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which pollinates flowers , the sources said . However , reports from farms indicate moisture levels are now generally back to near normal levels and that current flowering and pod setting is good , which should result in mature fruit from August through September . The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the main crop , which officially starts on October 1 . "" The cut - off date is completely artificial . If things go well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break from August through November or even December ,"" one said . If predictions of a 2 . 0 to 2 . 5 mln bag temporao prove accurate this would be below the 2 . 7 mln bag average for the past 10 years . The last poor temporao was in 1984 when prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1 . 79 mln bags , the lowest since 1974 . Good growing conditions the following year produced a temporao of 3 . 12 mln bags , just below the 1983 3 . 17 mln bag record , while last year ' s output , which also suffered some drought damage , was 2 . 77 mln bags . Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans . The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to have been undeclared from this year ' s record total harvest and they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the end of the official crop year on April 30 . Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port warehouses but not declared . Because of the high turnover of beans this year , significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored too long at the back of warehouses . Some of these are expected to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals . With official arrivals figures for the 1986 / 87 temporao and main crops totalling over 6 . 1 mln bags , and over seven weeks still to go to the end of the year , the total outturn should be at least a record 6 . 5 mln bags if all production is declared , the sources said . This would compare with the previous record set last year of 6 . 03 mln . However , there is no way of telling how many current crop beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao and thus the true size of the 1986 / 87 harvest may never be officially registered ."

35,"COCOA LATEST FOCUS FOR COMMODITY PACT NEGOTIATORS The credibility of government efforts to stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market , government delegates and trade experts said . Only two weeks ago , world coffee prices slumped when International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on how coffee export quotas should be calculated . This week , many of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work . The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the International Tin Council ( ITC ), which had buffer stock losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling , is also casting a shadow over commodity negotiations . The ITC ' s failure has restricted negotiators ' ability to compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts with built - in flaws or unlimited liability , but want clear lines drawn between aid and trade . A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva at the weekend . Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) buffer stock rules must not be muddied with quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to be bought . One consumer country delegate said this would "" distort , not support "" the market . Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can founder . On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa futures down to eight month lows . The strength of sterling has also contributed to the recent slip in prices . The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the "" must buy "" level of 1 , 600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact , which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but without rules for the operation of the buffer stock . Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should operate and what discretion it should be given . The agreement limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it cannot operate on futures markets . A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost 100 , 000 tonnes of cocoa , enough to mount large buying or selling operations , were carried forward from the previous agreement . Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on all cocoa they trade . It has an upper limit of 250 , 000 tonnes . The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be over non - member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should pay when trading different types of cocoa . Another working group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative matters , and the full council meets on Thursday . Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non - member countries such as Malaysia . Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate manufacturers for premium - priced high quality cocoas . The argument over buying non - member cocoa is closely linked to the one over differentials for different qualities . European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can represent non - member cocoa and that it use the London futures market ' s existing differentials for different qualities . Currently , good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto the London market . Discounts , which are currently under review , range up to 50 stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa . Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would operate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the highest priced cocoa in most demand , forcing all prices lower . The January talks were slowed by a split inside the European Community , a key ICCO consumer group , with France siding with producers . EC representatives met in closed session in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground and , a diplomatic source said , narrowed the range of positions among the 12 nations . The source said the EC will be looking for signs of flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and will be able to respond if they are there . One ICCO delegate describing the producer / consumer split said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and backs the concept of the pact which is "" meant to support the market where trade buying is not ."" In contrast , he said , producers seem to want to sell their cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers . Other , more technical , issues still outstanding include whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced "" posted price "" as in the previous pact or by announcing it is buying then accepting offers . In either case , delegates said , it is accepted that producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers ."
36,"COCOA CONSUMERS NARROW GAP ON BUFFER STOCK ISSUE Representatives of cocoa consuming countries at an International Cocoa Organization , ICCO , council meeting here have edged closer to a unified stance on buffer stock rules , delegates said . While consumers do not yet have a common position , an observer said after a consumer meeting , "" They are much more fluid ... and the tone is positive ."" European Community consumers were split on the question of how the cocoa buffer stock should be operated when the ICCO met in January to put the new International Cocoa Agreement into effect , delegates said . At the January meeting , France sided with producers on how the buffer stock should operate , delegates said . That meeting ended without agreement on new buffer stock rules . The EC Commission met in Brussels on Friday to see whether the 12 EC cocoa consuming nations could narrow their differences at this month ' s meeting . The Commissioners came away from the Friday meeting with an informal agreement to respond to signs of flexibility among producers on the key buffer stock issues , delegates said . The key issues to be addressed at this council session which divide ICCO members are whether non - member cocoa should be eligible for buffer stock purchases and what price differentials the buffer stock should pay for different types of cocoa , delegates said . A consumer delegate said producers and consumers should be able to compromise on the non - member cocoa question . A working group comprising delegates from all producing and consuming member countries met briefly this morning , then broke up into a producer meeting and an EC meeting , followed by a consumer meeting . Producers , who are in favour of the buffer stock buying a variety of grades of cocoa and oppose non - member cocoa being accepted , reviewed their position ahead of the working group meeting this afternoon . "" We are waiting to see what consumers say ,"" a producer delegate said . "" We hope they will be flexible or it will be difficult to negotiate ."" The ICCO comprises 33 member countries .

38,"ICCO TO EXAMINE BUFFER STOCK PROPOSAL TOMORRROW The International Cocoa Organization , ICCO , council adjourned after presenting divergent producer and consumer views on buffer stock rules and agreeing to examine a draft compromise proposal on the buffer stock issue tomorrow , delegates said .

"" I am optimistic we will be able to come to an agreement -- maybe not tomorrow or the next day , but some time later in the session ,"" a consumer delegate said . Producers say they want the buffer stock to consist only of ICCO member cocoa , comprise a representative basket of various grade cocoas and pay different prices for different grades , delegates said . Some consumers would rather the buffer stock manager be able to buy non - member cocoa also , and pay a single price for the buffer stock cocoa without respect to origin . Consumer members were not unified in their views on how the buffer stock should operate , with several countries backing different aspects of the producer stance , delegates said . The semi - annual council meeting is scheduled to run until March 27 . Consideration of the buffer stock rules is the most controversial topic on the agenda , delegates said ."

ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn was preparing the plan in consultation with other delegates for presentation to the full working group , they added ."
40,"ICCO GROUP LOOKS AT COCOA BUFFER STOCK RULE PLAN The International Cocoa Organization , ICCO , buffer stock working group began examining a draft proposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon , delegates said . The plan , presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn , represented a compromise between producer , European Community , EC , and other consumer views on how the buffer stock should operate , they said . The proposal involved three key principles . First , the buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather than using fixed posted prices as previously , delegates said . Under an offer system , the buffer stock manager would be free to choose cocoas of varying prices , they said . The second provision was that non - ICCO member cocoa could comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock , while the third laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa , to be set by a formula , the delegates said . After the plan was presented , working group delegates met briefly in smaller groups of producers , EC consumers and all consumers to look at the proposal . Producers gave no reaction to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group meets tomorrow at 1000 GMT , producer delegates said . Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to work from , one consumer delegate said . Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for negotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change ."

42,"ICCO MEMBERS ACCEPT BUFFER STOCK PRINCIPLES International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) producers and consumers accepted the principles of a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules as a basis for further negotiation , delegates said . The buffer stock working group then asked ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn , who wrote up the draft compromise , to flesh out details of the principles with the assistance of a representative group of delegates , they said . The working group broke up for the day , into a smaller group of five producers and five consumers to discuss administrative rules and into the group headed by Erbynn to hammer out buffer stock rules details , delegates said . Delegates said many differences of opinion still have to be ironed out . "" Whenever we start getting into details the clouds gather ,"" one delegate said . Erbynn is likely to present fleshed out details of the buffer stock rules proposal to the working group early tomorrow , delegates said . The principles of the draft proposal included establishing an offer system for buffer stock purchases rather than a posted price system , a limit to the amount of non - ICCO member cocoa that can be bought , and differentials to be paid for different varieties of cocoa comprising the buffer stock , delegates said ."

44,"N . Y . COCOA TRADERS STILL CAUTIOUS ON ICCO New York cocoa traders reacted with caution to today ' s developments at the International Cocoa Organization talks in London , saying there is still time for negotiations to break down . "" I would be extremely cautious to go either long or short at this point ,"" said Jack Ward , president of the cocoa trading firm Barretto Peat . "" If and when a final position comes out ( of the ICCO talks ) one will still have time to put on positions . The risk at the moment is not commensurate with the possible gain ."" ICCO producer and consumer delegates this morning accepted the outlines of a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules as a basis for further negotiation . A smaller group of representatives is now charged with fleshing out the details . "" Market sentiment has reflected optimism , I would ' t put it any stronger than that ,"" Ward said . "" It seems to put them slightly closer to an agreement ... but one shouldn ' t forget how much they have to negotiate ,"" said another trader of today ' s developments . Many dealers were sidelined coming into the negotiations and have remained so , traders said . "" The dealers have got historically small positions in outright terms ,"" one trader said . Speculators have gone net long "" but only slightly so ,"" he added . The recent price strength -- gains of about 52 dlrs the last two days -- has been due in large part to sterling ' s rally against the dollar and in the process has attracted a measure of origin selling , traders said ."
45,"COCOA DELEGATES OPTIMISTIC ON BUFFER STOCK RULES Hopes mounted for an agreement on cocoa buffer stock rules at an International Cocoa Organization , ICCO , council meeting which opened here today , delegates said . Both producer and consumer ICCO members said after the opening session that prospects for an agreement on the cocoa market support mechanism were improving . "" The chances are very good as of now of getting buffer stock rules by the end of next week ,"" Ghanaian delegate and producer spokesman Mama Mohammed told journalists . Consumer spokesman Peter Baron called the tone of the negotiations "" optimistic and realistic ."" The ICCO council failed to agree on buffer stock rules when a new International Cocoa Agreement came into force in January , with deep differences of opinion precluding serious discussions on the matter at that time . The existing buffer stock of about 100 , 000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen , with a funds balance of 250 mln dlrs . The ICCO made buffer stock rules negotiations a priority at this semi - annual council meeting in order to stop the slide in world cocoa prices . Consumers and producers agreed yesterday on the principles as a basis for negotiations . The council broke for lunch , and reconvenes at 1500 hrs . A working group which has been meeting since Monday will tackle the buffer stock rules issue again at 1600 hrs , when ICCO executive director Kobena Erbynn presents a fleshed - out version of a draft proposal he prepared earlier this week , delegates said . Mohammed said delegates will have a much clearer indication of prospects for an accord after details of the rules are elaborated by Erbynn , and after producers and consumers meet separately later today to examine the scheme . The draft proposal included three principles : a limit to non - member cocoa comprising the buffer stock , an offer system for buying buffer stock cocoa , and price differentials to be paid for various cocoas making up the buffer stock , delegates said . During the morning council session , the Ivory Coast delegation gave "" an open minded statement "" that it is willing to work out a buffer stock rules solution which could come into effect as soon as possible , Baron said . Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon , chairman of the ICCO council , was now expected to arrive in London Monday to attend the talks , Baron said . Vice chairman Sir Denis Henry of Grenada chaired the meeting in his place . Soviet and East German delegates did not attend the council session because of a conflicting International Sugar Organization meeting today , but could arrive this afternoon , delegates said ."

49,"COCOA BUFFER STOCK ACCORD CLOSER , DELEGATES SAY The International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) moved closer to an agreement on buffer stock rules , with many delegates saying they expect to reach an accord by Friday . "" Everyone is convinced the buffer stock rules should be in place by Friday so the buffer stock can be put into operation Monday ,"" a consumer delegate said . "" The atmosphere is excellent ."" Other delegates said the buffer stock might not be operational by Monday but could be in place by around April 1 , if the rules are agreed by Friday . A detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buy and sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working group this afternoon -- a big step toward a "" very interesting stage of negotiations ,"" delegates said . The package , based on negotiating principles informally agreed by delegates , has been forged bit by bit during fortnight - long meetings by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn and a small group of other delegates . Producers , the European Community ( EC ) and consumers are scheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointly tomorrow . Under the proposal , the buffer stock manager would buy cocoa from origins or the second - hand market on an offer system . He would alert the market via news agencies as to when he wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnage desired , delegates said . The manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis , rather than choosing the cheapest cocoa as before , giving preference to ICCO member - country exporters . Standard price differentials would be fixed for each origin , similar to golf handicaps , to determine the relative competitiveness of offers of various cocoas from different origins , they said . The differentials could be reviewed at the request of a member country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager , the delegates said . Revision would be decided by a majority vote of the ICCO council . Buffer stock purchases from non - ICCO member countries would not be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock , they said . The purchases would be limited to 5 , 000 tonnes of cocoa per day and 20 , 000 tonnes per week , and could be bought in nearby , intermediate and forward positions , they added . One of the underlying ideas of the rules package is "" transparency ,"" meaning virtually all the buffer stock manager ' s market activities will be public and he will have as little discretion as possible , delegates said . After the tin market collapse in 1985 , when the International Tin Council buffer stock ran out of funds , cocoa delegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa market mechanism , they said . Earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected to begin late tomorrow , as delegations feel the pressure of the approaching Friday deadline , when the ICCO meeting is due to adjourn , delegates said . The ICCO failed to agree buffer stock rules in January when the new International Cocoa Agreement came into force . The existing buffer stock of 100 , 000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen in place with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs -- both untouchable until rules are agreed . Though the current semi - annual council meeting is not the last chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules , producers are keen to get the wheels of the market - stabilizing mechanism turning to stem the decline in world prices , delegates said ."

51,"COCOA TALKS SLOW AT CRUCIAL STAGE - DELEGATES International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) talks on buffer stock rules have slowed during a crucial phase of negotiations , delegates said , but they remained confident about prospects for reaching agreement by Friday . Cocoa producers , European Community ( EC ) consumers and all consumers separately reviewed technical details of a buffer stock rules package distributed yesterday . The buffer stock working group of consumers and producers was set to meet later today to debate the proposal jointly for the first time , they said . Delegates said major sticking points were likely to be the amount of non - member cocoa allowed to be bought for the buffer stock , and the fixed price differentials at which different origin cocoas will be offered to the buffer stock manager . Producers would prefer that non - member cocoa not be included in the buffer stock because , if it is , countries such as Malaysia benefit from the cocoa agreement without joining it , the delegates said ."
52,"COCOA COUNCIL CHAIRMAN SEEKS BUFFER COMPROMISE International Cocoa Organization , ICCO , Council chairman , Denis Bra Kanon , said he will attempt to reach a compromise on buffer stock rules for the International Cocoa Agreement . Bra Kanon called for bilateral consultations among producers and consumers Thursday morning to resolve outstanding differences on how much non - member cocoa the buffer stock can purchase and differentials to be fixed for different origin cocoa , consumer delegates told reporters . Bra Kanon is expected to meet with about eight delegations individually in attempt to iron out remaining problems . Producers and consumers indicated support "" in principle "" for the draft buffer stock rules package formulated over the past week by a small working group , consumer delegates said . Despite remaining differences delegates remained confident a buffer stock accord would be agreed to by Friday when the council session ends , but certain technical points need further clarification , the delegates said . Certain consumers are concerned that differentials included in the draft buffer stock package are out of line with market realities , consumer delegates said . Unless these are modified there are fears it would promote purchases of quality cocoas , such as Ghana origin , which are normally required by manufacturers , they said . Restrictions on buffer stock purchases of non - member cocoa might lead to a supply overhang in Malaysian cocoa , which would depress prices , they added ."
53,"MADAGASCAR COCOA PRODUCTION ESTIMATED HIGHER Madagascar ' s cocoa production is estimated 13 pct higher this year at 2 , 720 tonnes , up from 2 , 400 in 1986 , Agriculture Ministry officials said . This improvement reflects the government ' s efforts over the last seven years to extend existing cocoa plantations and plant new higher yielding varieties , particularly at the northern tip of the island , they said . Last year , Madagascar exported 2 , 189 tonnes of high quality cocoa , up from 1 , 624 in 1985 , the Trade Ministry said . This year ' s exports are estimated at 2 , 400 tonnes ."
54,"COCOA COUNCIL HEAD TO PRESENT BUFFER COMPROMISE International Cocoa Organization , ICCO , council chairman Denis Bra Kanon will present a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules to producer and consumer delegates either later today or tomorrow morning , delegates said . Bra Kanon held private bilateral consultations with major producers and consumers this morning to resolve outstanding differences , mostly on the issues of how much non - member cocoa the buffer stock can purchase and price differentials for different varieties . Delegates were fairly confident the differences could be worked out in time to reach agreement tomorrow . Some consuming member nations , including Britain and Belgium , favour the buffer stock buying more than 10 pct non - member cocoa , delegates have said . The consumers argue that buying cheaper , lower quality non - member cocoas , particularly Malaysian , will most effectively support prices because that low quality cocoa is currently pressuring the market . Producers , meanwhile , say non - member cocoa should make up at most a very small percentage of the buffer . They say Malaysia should not be able to benefit from the ICCO unless it is a member , and if the buffer stock bought Malaysian cocoa Malaysia would have no incentive to join , delegates said . As to differentials , Ghana apparently wanted a higher differential for its cocoa than is outlined in the most recent proposal , so it would have a better chance of having its cocoa bought for the buffer stock , producer delegates said . Some consumers wanted differentials to be adjusted in a way that would not promote buffer stock purchases of the more expensive cocoas , such as Ghanaian and Brazilian , they said . Other technical points need to be sorted out , including limits on how much cocoa the buffer stock manager can buy in nearby , intermediate and forward positions and the consequent effect on prices in the various deliveries , delegates said ."
